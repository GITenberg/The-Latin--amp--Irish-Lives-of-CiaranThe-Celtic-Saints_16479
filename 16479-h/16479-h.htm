<h1>THE LATIN AND IRISH LIVES<br /><br />
OF CIARAN</h1>
<br /><br />

<h2><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>
Of all the saints of Ireland, whose names are recorded
in the native Martyrologies, probably there were none
who made so deep an impression upon the minds of
their fellow-countrymen as did <a name="I1r" id="I1r"></a>Ciaran<a href="#I1"><sup>1</sup></a> of Clonmacnois.
He stands, perhaps, second only to Brigit of Kildare in
this respect; for Patrick was a foreigner, and Colum
Cille accomplished his work and exercised his influence
outside the shores of Ireland.</p>
<p>
Doubtless much of the importance of Ciaran is reflected
back from the outstanding importance of his great
foundation&mdash;the monastic university, as it is fair to call
it, of <i>Cluain maccu Nois</i> (in an English setting spelt
"Clonmacnois"), on the shore of the Shannon. But
this cannot be the whole explanation of the esteem in
which he was held; it must be at least partly due to
the memory of his own character and personality.</p>
<p>
Such a conclusion is indicated if we examine critically
the <i>Lives</i> of this saint, translations of which are given
in the present volume, and compare them with the lives
of other Irish saints. In studying all these documents we<span class="page"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[page 2]</span>
must bear in mind that none of them are, in any modern
sense of the word, biographies. A biography, in the
proper definition of the term, gives an ordered account
of the life of its subject, with dates, and endeavours
to trace the influences which shaped his character and
his career, and the manner in which he himself influenced
his surroundings. The so-called lives of saints are
properly to be regarded as <i>homilies</i>. They were composed
to be read to assemblies of the Faithful, as sermons
for the festivals of the saints with whom they deal;
and their purpose was to edify the hearers by presenting
catalogues of the virtues of their subjects, and, especially,
of their thaumaturgic powers. Thus they do not possess
the unity of ordered and well-designed biographies;
they consist of disconnected anecdotes, describing how
this event or that gave occasion for a miraculous
display.</p>
<p>
It follows that to the historian in search of unvarnished
records of actual fact these documents are useless, without
most drastic criticism. They were compiled long
after the time of their subjects, from tales, doubtless
at first, and probably for a considerable time, transmitted
by oral tradition. It would be natural that there
should be much cross-borrowing, tales told about one
saint being adapted to others as well, until they became
stock incidents. It would also be nothing more than
natural that many elements in the Lives should be
survivals from more ancient mythologies, having their
roots in pre-Christian beliefs. Nevertheless, none of these
writings are devoid of value as pictures of life and
manners; and even in descriptions of incredible and
pointless miracles precious scraps of folk-lore are often
embedded. In most, if not in all, cases, the incidents
recorded in the Lives are to be criticised as genuine
traditions, whatever their literal historicity may be;<span class="page"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[page 3]</span>
few, if any, are conscious inventions or <a name="I2r" id="I2r"></a>impostures.<a href="#I2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>
In the Lives of Ciaran there are many conventional
incidents of this kind, which reappear in the lives
of other saints. In the Annotations in the present
edition a few such parallels are quoted; though no
attempt is made to give an exhaustive list, the compilation
of which would occupy more time and space than
its scientific value would warrant. But there are certain
other incidents of a more individual type, and it is these
which make the Lives of Ciaran especially remarkable.
They may well be genuine reminiscences of the real
life, or at least of the real character of the man himself.
Thus, there are a number of coincidences, clearly undesigned
(noted below, p. 104) consistently pointing to a
pre-Celtic parentage for the saint. Again, the saint's
mother is represented as a strong personality, with a
decided strain of "thrawnness" in her composition;
while the saint himself is shown to us as distinguished
by a beautiful unselfishness. This, it must be confessed,
is very far from being a common character of the Irish
saints, as they are represented to us by the native hagiologists;
and in any case the character-drawing of the
average Irish saint's life is so rudimentary, that when we
are thus enabled to detect well-defined traits, we are
quite justified in accepting them as based on the tradition
of the actual personality of the saint. In other
words, so deep was the impression which the man made<span class="page"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[page 4]</span>
upon his contemporaries during his short life, that his
<i>memorabilia</i> seem to be, on the whole, of a more
definitely historic nature than are those of other Irish
saints.</p>
<p>
There is, however, a disturbing element which must
be kept in mind in criticising the Lives of Ciaran. He
was the son of a carpenter, and he was said to have died
at the age of thirty-three. It is quite clear that these
coincidences with the facts of the earthly parentage and
death of Christ were observed by the homilists&mdash;indeed
the author of the Irish Life says as much, at the end of
his work. They provoked a natural and perhaps wholly
unconscious desire to draw other parallels; and if we
may use a convenient German technical term, there is a
traceable <i>Tendenz</i> in this direction, as is indicated in
the Annotations on later pages. It is not to be supposed
that even these apparently imitative incidents are (not
to mince matters) mere pious frauds; they may well
have come into existence in the folk-consciousness automatically,
before they received their present literary
form. But such a development could hardly have
centred in an unworthy subject; there must have been
a well-established tradition of a <i>Christ-likeness</i> of character
in the man, for such parallels in detail to have
taken <a name="I3r" id="I3r"></a>shape.<a href="#I3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
The homiletic purpose of these documents is most
clearly shown in the Irish Life. This was written to be
preached as a sermon on the saint's festival ["this day
<i>to-day</i>," § 1], at Clonmacnois ["he came <i>to this town</i>,"
§ 34: "a fragment of the cask remained <i>here</i> till
recently," § 36: "<i>here</i> are the relics of Ciaran," § 41.
Similarly the First Latin Life, § 35, calls the saint "<i>Our</i><span class="page"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[page 5]</span>
most holy patron"]. The actual date of the Irish sermon
is less easy to fix; the language has been modernised
step by step in the process of transmission from manuscript
to manuscript, but originally it may have been
written about the eleventh century, though incorporating
fragments of earlier material. The passage just
quoted, saying that a certain relic had remained <i>till
recently</i>, may possibly indicate that the homily had been
delivered shortly after one of the many burnings and
plunderings which the monastery suffered; in such a
calamity the relic might have perished. The prophecy
put into Ciaran's mouth, that "there would be great
persecution of his city from evil men in the end of the
world" [Irish Life, § 38] seems to relate to such an
event: it is very suggestive that exactly the same exprestion
"great persecution from evil men" (<i>ingrem mór ó
droch-daoinibh</i>) is used in the <i>Chronicon Scotorum</i> of
certain raids on the monastery which took place in the
year A.D. 1091; and that on the strength of an old
prophecy there was a belief in Ireland that the world
was destined to come to an end in the year 1096, as we
learn from the <i>Annals of the Four Masters</i> under that
<a name="I4r" id="I4r"></a>date.<a href="#I4"><sup>4</sup></a> It must, however, be remembered that a date
determined for a single incident does not necessarily
date the whole compilation containing it.</p>
<p>
The text of the First Latin Life (here called for convenience
of reference LA) is found in an early fifteenth-century
MS. in Marsh's Library, Dublin. It has been
edited, without translation, by the Rev. C. Plummer<span class="page"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[page 6]</span>
in his most valuable <i>Vitae Sanctorum Hiberniae</i> (Oxford,
1910) vol. i, pp. 200-216. The translation given in this
volume has been made from Plummer's edition, which
I have collated with the original <a name="I5r" id="I5r"></a>MS.<a href="#I5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>
The text of the Second Latin Life (LB) is contained
in two MSS. in the Bodleian Library (Rawl. B 485 and
Rawl. B 505, here called R1 and R2). Of these R2
is a direct copy of R1, as has been proved by Plummer,
in his description of these <a name="I6r" id="I6r"></a>manuscripts.<a href="#I6"><sup>6</sup></a> As to their
date, there is no agreement; the estimate for R1
ranges from the first half of the thirteenth to the
fourteenth century, R2 being necessarily somewhat
later. The Life of Ciaran contained in these MSS. has
been used by Plummer in editing LA, and extracts
from it are printed in his footnotes. It has not, however,
been previously printed in its entirety, and a transcript
made by myself is therefore added here, in an<span class="page"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[page 7]</span>
Appendix.</p>
<p>
The text of the Third Latin Life (LC) is contained in
the well-known Brussels MS., called <i>Codex Salmaticensis</i>
from its former sojourn at Salamanca. It is of the
fourteenth century. This was the only continuous
authority at the disposal of the compiler of the Bollandist
life of our saint; he speaks of it in the most contemptuous
terms. The life of Ciaran in this manuscript is a mere
fragment, evidently copied from an imperfect exemplar;
there seems to have been a chasm in the middle, and there
is a lacuna at the end, which the scribe has endeavoured
to conceal by adding the words "Finit, Amen." The
translation here given has been prepared from the edition
of the Salamanca MS. by de Smedt and de Backer, cols.
155-160.</p>
<p>
The Irish Life (here denoted VG, i.e. <i>Vita Goedelica</i>)
was edited by Whitley Stokes from the late fifteenth-century
MS. called the <i>Book of <a name="I7r" id="I7r"></a>Lismore</i>.<a href="#I7"><sup>7</sup></a> The numerous
errors in the Lismore text may be to some extent corrected
by collation with another Brussels MS., written
in the seventeenth century by Micheál ó Cléirigh. Stokes
has indicated the more important readings of the Brussels
MS. in his edition. The scribe of the Lismore Text
was conscious of the defects of his copy: for in a note
appended to the Life of our saint, he says, "It is not I
who am responsible for the meaningless words in this
<i>Life</i>, but the bad manuscript"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the imperfect
exemplar of which he was making a transcript.</p>
<p>
There were other Lives of the saint in existence, apparently
no longer extant. Of these, one was in the hands
of the hagiographer Sollerius: for in his edition of the
<i>Martyrologium</i> of Usuardus (Antwerp, 1714, p. 523) he
says, <i>Querani, Kirani, uel Kiriani uitam MS. habemus</i>.<span class="page"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[page 8]</span>
<i>uariaque ad eam annotata, quae suo tempore digerentur</i>.
This promise he does not appear to have fulfilled; the
Bollandist compiler, as we have just noticed, had no
materials but the imperfect Salamanca Life, and was
forced to fill its many gaps as best he could, by diligently
collecting references to Ciaran in the lives of other saints.
Another Life of the saint seems to be referred to in the
<i>Martyrology of Donegal</i>; under the 10th May that
compilation quotes a certain "Life of Ciaran of Cluain"
(<i>i.e.</i> Clonmacnois) as the authority for a statement to the
effect that "the order of Comgall [of Bangor, Co. Down]
was one of the eight orders that were in Ireland." It
would be irrelevant to discuss here the meaning of this
statement; its importance for us lies in the fact that the
sentence is not found in any of the extant Lives, so that
some other text, now unknown, must be in question.</p>
<p>
Ciaran of Clonmacnois was not the only saint of that
name. Besides his well-known namesake of Saighir
(Seir-Kieran, King's Co.), there were a few lesser stars
called Ciaran, and there is danger of confusion between
them. The name reappears in Cornwall, with the regular
Brythonic change of Q to P, in the form Pieran or Pirran.
This Pieran is wrongly identified by <a name="I8r" id="I8r"></a>Skene<a href="#I8"><sup>8</sup></a> with our
saint; a single glance at the abstract of the Life of St.
Pieran given by Sir T.D. <a name="I9r" id="I9r"></a>Hardy<a href="#I9"><sup>9</sup></a> will show how mistaken
this identification is. A similar confusion is probably
at the base of the curious statement in Adam King's
<i>Scottish Kalendar of Saints</i>, that Queranus was an "abot
in Scotl&#257;d under king Ethus, [anno] 876" and of
Camerarius' description of him as "abbas Foilensis in
<a name="I10r" id="I10r"></a>Scotia."<a href="#I10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>
The four documents of which translations are printed<span class="page"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[page 9]</span>
in this book relate almost, though not quite, the same
series of incidents. There is a sufficient divergence
between them, both in selection and in order, as well
as in the minor details, to make the determination of
their mutual relationship a difficult problem. We must
regard all four as independent compositions, though
based on a common group of sources, which, in the
first instance, were doubtless disjointed <i>memorabilia</i>,
preserved by oral tradition in Clonmacnois. These
would in time gradually become fitted into the four
obvious phases of the saint's actual life&mdash;his boyhood,
his schooldays, his wanderings, and his final settlement
at Clonmacnois. It is not difficult to form a plausible
theory as to how the systematisation took place, and
also as to how the slight variants between different
versions of the same story arose. The composition of
hymns to the founder and patron would surely be a
favourite literary exercise in Clonmacnois. In such
hymns the different incidents would be told and re-told,
the details varying with the knowledge and the metrical
skill of the versifiers. There are excerpts from such
hymns, in Irish, scattered through VG: and LB ends
with a <i>pasticcio</i> of similar fragments in Latin. As a
number of different metres are employed, both in the
Irish and in the Latin extracts, there must have been
at least as many independent compositions drawn upon
by the compilers of the prose Lives: and it is noteworthy
that there are occasionally discrepancies in detail between
the verse fragments and their present prose setting.
Most probably the prose Lives were based directly on
the hymns; one preacher would use one hymn as his
chief authority, another would use another, and thus
the petty differences between them would become fixed,
perhaps exaggerated as the prose writer filled in details
for which the exigencies of verse allowed no scope. It<span class="page"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[page 10]</span>
is probably impossible to carry the history of the tradition
further.</p>
<p>
In order to facilitate comparison between the four
documents, I have divided them into <i>incidents</i>, and have
provided titles to each. These titles are so chosen that
they may be used for every presentation of the incident,
however the details may vary. The titles are numbered
with <i>Roman</i> numerals, whilst the successive incidents
within each of the Lives are numbered consecutively
with <i>Arabic</i> numerals. The <i>Harmony of the Four Lives</i>,
which follows this Introduction, will make cross-reference
easy.</p>
<p>
No modern biography, no edition of the ancient homiletic
Lives, of Ciaran could be considered complete
without a history of Clonmacnois, through which being
dead he yet spake to his countrymen for a thousand years.
It was the editor's intention to include such a history
in the present volume; and this part of the projected
work was drafted. But as it progressed, and as the
indispensable material increased in bulk, it became
evident that it would be impossible to do justice to the
subject within the narrow limits of a volume of the
present series. A slight or superficial history of Clonmacnois
would be worse than none, as it would block
the way for the fuller treatment which the subject well
deserves. The materials collected for this part of the
work have therefore been reserved for the present:
it is hoped that their publication will not be long
delayed.</p>

The boyhood legend probably consisted originally<span class="page"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[page 12]</span>
of the five incidents common to all, II-V, IX. It is noteworthy,
however, that LB transfers V, IX, to a position
after the second phase of the Life. This is possibly
due to a misplaced leaf in the exemplar from which our
copies of LB are derived. X-XIII, variants on the
theme of XIV, are probably interpolations in LA, and
VIII, a valuable fragment of folk-lore, is an interpolation
in VG. VI and VII are conflations of two varieties
of one incident, as is pointed out in the Annotations.
These observations will show how complex is the criticism
of the Ciaran tradition.</p>
<p>
<b>B.</b> The second phase of the life is the Schooling of
Ciaran at Clonard; perhaps about 530-535, still using
round numbers. This part of the life is most fully told
in VG; it is very fragmentary in all the Latin Lives.
There are thirteen incidents&mdash;</p>

<b>C.</b> The third phase may be called the Wanderings
of Ciaran. From Clonard he made his way to the monastery
of Ninnedh on the island in Loch Erne now called
Inismacsaint (it is to be noted that VG knows nothing<span class="page"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[page 13]</span>
of this visit). From Loch Erne he went to Aran, thence
(after a visit to Saint Senan on Scattery Island) to his
brother's monastery at Isel, a place not certainly identified.
After this he removes to Inis Aingin, now Hare
Island in Loch Ree, which is his last halting-place before
reaching his goal at Clonmacnois. There are twelve
incidents. The first forms incident 13 of LC, which
then breaks off; this text therefore no longer requires
a special column. The wander-years end with 548, the
year of the saint's arrival at Clonmacnois.</p>

The difference of opinion as to the setting of incident
XXXIII is to be noted. Also noteworthy is the absence
of any reference to a second visit to Senan, though such
is postulated in the lives of the latter saint.</p>
<p>
<b>D.</b> The fourth phase covers the time&mdash;according
to all our texts a few months, according to other
authorities some years&mdash;intervening between the foundation
of Clonmacnois and the death of Ciaran. The
traditions of LA and VG here run along the same lines;
LB is curiously diverse. There are in all twelve incidents,<span class="page"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[page 14]</span>

<h2>THE FIRST LATIN LIFE OF SAINT CIARAN</h2>
<br />
<p>
<i>Here beginneth the Life of Saint <a name="one1r" id="one1r"></a>Kiaranus,<a href="#one1"><sup>1</sup></a> Abbot and
Confessor.</i></p>
<br />

<h4>II. THE ORIGIN AND BIRTH OF CIARAN: THE WIZARD'S PROPHECIES</h4>
<p>
<b>1.</b> The holy abbot Kyaranus sprang from the people
of the Latronenses, which are in the region of Midhe,
that is, in the middle of Ireland. His father, who was a
cart-wright, was called Beonnadus; now the same was
a rich man; and he took him a wife by name Derercha,
of whom he begat five sons and three daughters. Of
these there were four priests and one deacon, who were
born in this order, with these names&mdash;the first Lucennus,
the second Donanus, the third that holy abbot Kyaranus,
the fourth Odranus, the fifth Cronanus, who was the
deacon. Also the three daughters were named Lugbeg,
and Raichbe, and Pata. Lugbeg and Raichbe were
two holy virgins; Pata, however, was at first married,
but afterwards she was a holy widow. Now inasmuch
as the wright Beonedus himself was grievously burdened
by the imposts of Ainmireach King of Temoria, he,
eluding the pressure of the impost, departed from his
own region, that is from the coasts of Midhe, into the
territories of the Conactha. There he dwelt in the plain
of Aei, with the king Crimthanus; and there he begat
Saint Kyaranus, whose Life this is.</p>
<p>
Now his birth was prophesied by a wizard of the aforesaid<span class="page"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[page 16]</span>
king, who said, before all the folk, "The son who
is in the womb of the wife of Beoedus the wright shall
be had in honour before God and before men; as the sun
shineth in heaven so shall he himself by his holiness
shine in Ireland." Afterwards Saint Kyaranus was
born in the province of the Connachta, namely in the
plain of Aei, in the stronghold called Raith Crimthain;
and he was baptized by a certain holy deacon who was
called Diarmaid in the Scotic [= Irish] tongue; but
afterwards he was named Iustus, for it was fitting that a
"just one" should be baptized by a "Iustus." And
Saint Ciaran was reared with his parents in the aforesaid
place, and by all things the grace of God was manifested
within him.</p><br />


<h4>III. HOW CIARAN RAISED THE STEED OF OENGUS FROM DEATH</h4>
<p>
<b>2.</b> One day the best horse of Aengussius, son of the
aforesaid King Crimhthanus, died suddenly, and he was
greatly distressed at the death of his best horse. Now
when in sorrow he had fallen asleep, in his dreams a
shining man appeared to him, saying to him, "Sorrow
not concerning thy horse, for among you there is a boykin
[<i>puerulus</i>], Saint Kiaranus son of Beoedus the wright,
who by God's grace can quicken thy horse. Let him
pour water into the mouth of the horse, with prayer,
and upon its face, and forthwith it shall arise sound.
And do thou bestow a gift on the boy for the quickening
of thy horse." Now when Aengus son of the king was
awakened out of sleep, he told these words to his friends;
and he himself came to Saint Kyaranus and led him up
to the place where the horse was lying dead. When the
dutiful boy Kyaranus poured water into the mouth and
on the face of the horse, it forthwith rose from death<span class="page"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[page 17]</span>
and stood whole before them all. The son of the king
bestowed that field, which was great and the best, upon
Saint Kiaranus in perpetuity.</p><br />


<h4>IV. HOW CIARAN TURNED WATER INTO HONEY</h4>
<p>
<b>3.</b> On another day the mother of Saint Kyaranus upbraided
him, saying, "The sensible other boys bring
honey to their parents every day, from the fields and
the places where honey is found. But this our son,
weak and soft as he is, bringeth us no honey." The
holy boy Kyaranus, hearing this saying of his mother
chiding him, made his way to a spring hard by, and thence
filled a vessel with water. When he blessed it, honey of
the best was made from the water, and he gave it to his
mother. But his parents, astonished at the miracle, sent
that honey to the deacon Iustus, who had baptized him,
that he might himself see the miracle wrought by God
through the boy whom he baptized. When he had heard
and seen it, he gave thanks to Christ, and prayed for the
boy.</p><br />


<h4>VI. HOW CIARAN AND HIS INSTRUCTOR CONVERSED, THOUGH DISTANT FROM ONE ANOTHER</h4>
<p>
<b>4.</b> The holy boy Kyaranus, as he kept the flocks of
his parents, was wont to read the Psalms with Saint
Diarmatus. But that teaching was imparted in a manner
to us most wondrous. For Saint Kiaranus was keeping
the flocks in the southern part of the plain of Aei, and
Saint Diarmatus was dwelling in the northern part of
the same plain, and the plain was of great extent between
them. And thus, from afar off, they would salute each
the other at ease, with words, across the spaces of the
plain; and the elder would teach the boy from his cell
across the plain, and the boy would read, sitting upon<span class="page"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[page 18]</span>
a rock in the field. The which rock is reverenced unto
this day, as the Cross of Christ, called by the name of
Kyaranus, is placed upon it. Now thus by divine favour
were the holy ones wont to hear each the other, while
others heard them not.</p><br />


<h4>IX. HOW CIARAN RESTORED A CALF WHICH A WOLF HAD DEVOURED</h4>
<p>
<b>5.</b> On a day when Saint Kyaranus was keeping the
herds, a cow gave birth to a calf in his presence. Now
in that hour the dutiful boy saw a wretched wasted
hungry wolf a-coming towards him, and God's servant
said to him, "Go, poor wretch, and devour that calf."
Forthwith the famished hound fell upon the calf and
devoured it. But when the holy herd-boy had come home
with his herds, the cow, seeking her calf, was making
a loud outcry; and when Derercha, mother of Saint
Kyaranus, saw it, she said unto him, "Kyaranus, where
is the calf of yonder cow? Restore it, although it be
from sea or from land. For thou has lost it, and its
mother's heart is sore vexed." When Saint Kyaranus
heard these words, he returned to the place where the
calf was devoured, and collected its bones into his breast;
then returning, he laid them before the cow as she
lamented. Straightway, by divine mercy, by reason
of the holiness of the boy, the calf arose before them all,
and stood whole upon its feet, sporting with its mother.
Then those who stood by lifted up their voices in praise
to God, blessing the boy.</p><br />


<h4>V. HOW CIARAN WAS DELIVERED FROM A HOUND</h4>
<p>
<b>6.</b> As the dutiful boy Kyaranus was going out to a
homestead hard by, certain worldly men, cruel and malignant,
let loose a most savage hound at him, so that it <span class="page"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[page 19]</span>
should devour him. When Saint Kyaranus saw the
fierce hound coming towards him, he appropriated a
verse of the Psalmist, saying, "Lord, deliver not the
soul that trusteth in Thee unto beasts." Now as the
hound was rushing vehemently, by divine favour it
thrust its head into the ring-fastening of a calf; and
tied by the ring-fastening, it struck its head against
the timber to which the fastening was hanging, and thus
it broke its head. Its head being broken and the brains
scattered, the dog expired. When they saw this they
feared greatly.</p><br />


<h4>X. HOW CIARAN WAS DELIVERED FROM ROBBERS</h4>
<p>
<b>7.</b> On another day certain robbers, coming from a
foreign region, found Saint Kiaranus alone, reading
beside his herds; and they thought to slay him and to
reave his herds. But as they came toward him with that
intent, they were smitten with blindness, and could
move neither hand nor foot till they had wrought repentance,
praying him for their sight.  Then the dutiful
shepherd, seeing them turned from their wickedness,
prayed for them, and forthwith they were loosed and
their sight restored (<i>soluti sunt in lumine suo</i>). And
they returned and offered thanks, and told this to many.</p>
<br />

<h4>XI. HOW CIARAN GAVE A GlFT OF CATTLE</h4>
<p>
<b>8.</b> One day a certain poor man came to Saint Kyeranus,
and begged of him a cow. Then Saint Kieranus asked
of his mother that a cow should be given to the poor
man; but his mother would not hearken unto him.
When Saint Kieranus saw this, he made the poor man
accompany him out of doors with the herds, and there he
gave unto him a good cow with her calf. Now the calf
itself was between two kine, and both of them had a<span class="page"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[page 20]</span>
care for it; and as the dutiful boy knew that the second
cow would be of no service without the calf, he gave them
both, with their calf, to the poor man. For these, on
the following day, four kine were gifted to Saint Kiaranus
by other folk as an alms, and these he gave to his mother
as she was chiding him. Then he exhorted his mother
in reasonable manner, and she was thereafter in awe
of him.</p><br />


<h4>XII. HOW CIARAN GAVE A GIFT OF A PLOUGH-COULTER</h4>
<p>
<b>9.</b> Saint Kiaranus on another day gave the coulter
of his uncle Beoanus to a certain poor man, for which
likewise on another day he received four coulters.
For four smiths came from the steading called Cluain
Cruim, with four coulters, which they delivered for an
alms to Saint Kyaranus; and these the holy boy restored
to him for his coulter.</p><br />


<h4>XIII. HOW CIARAN GAVE A GIFT OF AN OX</h4>
<p>
<b>10.</b> On another day Saint Kyaranus gave the ox of the
same uncle to a man who begged for it. And he said
unto him, "Son, how shall I be able to plough to-day,
seeing that thou hast given mine ox to another?" To
him responded the holy boy, "Set thou to-day thy horse
with the oxen in the plough, and to-morrow thou shalt
have oxen enough." Forthwith the horse, set under
the yoke with the oxen, in place of the ox that had
been given, became tame; and the whole day it ploughed
properly under the yoke, like an ox. On the following
day four oxen were gifted for an alms to Saint Kiaranus,
and these he delivered to his uncle instead of his ox.
For men who heard and saw the great signs wrought
by Saint Kyaranus were wont to beg for his prayers,<span class="page"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[page 21]</span>
and to offer oblations unto him.</p>
<br />

<h4>XIV. HOW CIARAN GAVE THE KING'S CAULDRON TO BEGGARS, AND WAS ENSLAVED</h4>
<p>
<b>11.</b> One day the father of Saint Kiaranus bore a
royal vessel from the house of King Furbithus, to keep
it for some days. Now the king treasured that vessel.
But Saint Kiaranus delivered that vessel of the king
to certain poor men who asked an alms in Christ's name,
as he had nothing else. When the king heard this, his
anger was kindled mightily, and he commanded that
Saint Kiaranus should be enslaved to his service. And
so for this cause was blessed Kiaranus led into captivity,
and was a slave in the house of King Furbithus. A task
chosen for its severity was laid upon him, namely, to
turn the quern-stone daily for making flour. But in
wondrous wise Saint Kiaranus used to sit and read
beside the quern-stone, and the quern-stone used to turn
swiftly of itself, without the hand of man, and to grind
corn before all the folk. For the angels of God were
grinding for Saint Kyaranus, unseen of men. And after
no long time a certain man of the province of Mumenia,
that is, of the people of the Desi, who was called Hiernanus,
stirred up by divine favour, came with two most
excellent vessels, like unto the vessel of that king, of
the same sort and the same use, and gifted them in alms
to Saint Kiaranus. When the king heard the miracle
of the quern-stone, he accepted those two vessels, and
gave his liberty to Saint Kiaranus; for beforetime he
would not for anger accept a ransom for him. Thus
was Saint Kiaranus freed from the servitude of the king;
and Saint Kiaranus blessed that man with his tribe,
by whom he himself obtained his liberty.</p><br />

<span class="page"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[page 22]</span>
<h4>XXXIII. HOW A PROPHECY WAS FULFILLED</h4>
<p>
<b>12.</b> On a certain day when Saint Kieranus was in
the place called Cluain Innsythe, he saw a ship floating
on the river, and he saw a hut on the bank of the river.
Now there was a platter woven of twigs within it, full
of ears of corn, with fire underneath so that they should
be dried for grinding, as was the custom of the western
people, that is, of Britain and of Ireland. Saint Kyaranus
said in prophecy, secretly, to his companions,  "Yonder
ship which is on the waters shall be burned to-day, and
the hut which is on land shall be submerged." As they
disputed and wondered, he said, "Wait a little space,
and ye shall see it with your eyes." Forthwith that
shiplet was raised from the water on to the land, and
placed in a shed that its leaks and cracks might there be
caulked. But a bonfire having been lit, the shed was
consumed, and the ship in its midst was likewise consumed.
But strong men, wrenching the hut out of the
ground, cast it from the bank into the river, and there
it was submerged, as the servant of the Lord prophesied.
When they heard and saw such a prophecy of things
contrary, they gave glory to Christ who giveth such a
gift unto his servants.</p><br />


<h4>XV. HOW CIARAN REPROVED HIS MOTHER</h4>
<p>
<b>13.</b> On another day when Saint Kiaranus had come
from the fields to his home, men came meeting him.
To them he said, "Whence have ye now come?" They
said, "We come now from the house of Beoedus the
wright." Said he to them, "Have ye gotten there
fitting refreshment for Christ's sake?" They said,
"Nay; but we found there a hard woman who
would not for hospitality give us so much as a drink."
When Saint Kyaranus heard this, he blessed them, and
came swiftly to his house, and entering the house he<span class="page"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[page 23]</span>
found no one therein, for its inmates were busied with
their work out of doors. Then blessed Kyaranus, moved
with zeal for God, scattered all the food which he found
in the house of his parents; <a name="one2r" id="one2r"></a>for<a href="#one2"><sup>2</sup></a> the milk he poured
on the ground, the butter he mixed with the sheep's
dung, the bread he cast to the dogs, so that it should
be of service to no man. For he was showing that
whatsoever was not given to guests for Christ's name
should rightly be devoted by men to loss, lest such food
should be eaten. After a little space his mother came,
and seeing her house thus turned upside-down, she felt
moved to raise an outcry; for she marvelled greatly
at what had befallen her house. When Saint Kiaranus
had set forth the reason, she became calm, and promised
amendment; and many of those who heard were
rendered charitable.</p><br />


<h4>XVI. THE BREAKING OF THE CARRIAGE-AXLE</h4>
<p>
<b>14.</b> On another day when Saint Kyaranus was sitting
in a carriage with his father, the axle of the carriage
broke in two in the middle of the plain; and the father
of the saint, with his attendants, was distressed. Then
Saint Kyeranus blessed the axle, and it was forthwith
made whole again as it had been before; and afterwards
for the entire day they travelled in the carriage safely.</p>
<br />

<h4>XVII. HOW CIARAN WENT WITH HIS COW TO THE SCHOOL OF FINDIAN</h4>
<p>
<b>15.</b> After this Saint Kyaranus wished to leave his
parents and to go forth to the school of Saint Finnianus,
who was a wise man abounding in all holiness; so that
he might there read the Scriptures, with the other saints<span class="page"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[page 24]</span>
of Ireland who were there. He asked of his parents
that a cow might be led with him to the school, for the
sake of her milk to sustain him; but his mother denied
it, saying, "Others who are in that school have no kine."
Then having received the licence and blessing of his
parents&mdash;though his mother was grieved, for she wished
to have him always with herself&mdash;Saint Kyaranus went
on his way.</p>
<p>
Coming to the cattle of his parents, he blessed a cow,
and commanded her in the name of the Lord to follow
him. Forthwith that cow followed him with her new-born
calf; and wheresoever he would go the cow walked
after him, to the city of Cluayn Irayrd, which is in the
boundary of the Laginenses and Ui Neill. But the city
itself lies in the territory of Ui Neill.</p>
<p>
When Saint Kyeranus had come thither, he used to
make a barrier in the pastures between the cow and her
calf with his rod; and by no means did they ever dare
to cross the tracks of the holy rod, nor used they cross
it; but the cow would lick her calf across the track of
the rod, and at the proper time they would come to
their stall, with full store of milk.</p>
<p>
That cow was of a dun colour, and was called <i>Odar
Ciarain</i>, "Ciaran's Dun." Her fame endures for ever
in Ireland, for she used to have the greatest store of milk,
such as at this time could not be believed. Her milk
was daily divided among the school, and sufficed for
many. Her hide in like manner remains to this day
honourably in the city of Saint Kiaranus; for through it,
by the grace of God, miracles are wrought. This grace
greater than all it has, as the holy ancients, the disciples
of Saint Kiaranus, have delivered unto us; that it is
revealed by divine inspiration that every man who shall
have died upon it shall possess eternal life with Christ.</p>
<br />
<span class="page"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[page 25]</span>
<h4>XVIII.  THE ANGELS GRIND FOR CIARAN</h4>
<p>
<b>16.</b> Now in the school of the most holy master Finnianus
there were many saints of Ireland; to wit, two
Saints Kiaranus, and two Saints Brendanus, Columba,
and many others; and each of them on his day would
grind with his own hands on the quern. But the angels
of God used to grind for Saint Kiaranus, as they did
for him in his captivity.</p>

<br />
<h4>XIX. CIARAN AND THE KING'S DAUGHTER</h4>
<p>
<b>17.</b> The daughter of the King of Temoria was conducted
to Saint Finnianus that she might read the Psalms
and the other Scriptures with the saint of God, and
should dedicate her virginity. And when she promised
of her own free will to preserve her virginity for Christ,
Father Finnianus said to Saint Kiaranus, "Son, let this
virgin, Christ's handmaid, daughter of an earthly king,
read with thee in the meanwhile, till such time as a cell
of virgins shall be built for her." Which duty Saint
Kiaranus obediently accepted, and the virgin read with
him the Psalms and other lections. Now when holy
Father Finnianus was establishing that virgin and other
holy virgins in a cell, the blessed fathers questioned
Saint Kiaranus as to her manners and her virtue. To
them Kiaranus said; "Verily, I know naught of her
virtues, of manners or of body; for God hath known
that never have I seen her face, nor aught of her save
the lower part of her vesture, when she was coming from
her parents; nor have I held any converse with her save
only her reading." For she was wont to take her refection,
and to sleep, with a certain holy widow. And the
virgin spake the like testimony of Saint Kiaranus, and
many were confirmed in the true faith by other testimonies
of them.</p>
<br />
<span class="page"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[page 26]</span>
<h4>XXII. THE STORY OF CIARAN'S GOSPEL</h4>
<p>
<b>18.</b> Saint Kiaranus was reading the gospel of Matthew
with holy Father Finnianus, along with others. And
when he had come to the place where, in the middle of
the book, it is written "All things whatsoever ye would
that men should do unto you, so do ye unto them,"
Saint Kiaranus said to Saint Finnianus, "Father, enough
for me is this half of this book which I have read, that
I may fulfil it in deed; verily this one sentence is enough
for me to learn." Then one of the school said to them all,
"Henceforth a fitting name for Kiaranus is '<i>Leth-Matha</i>'
(Half-Matthew)." To him the holy elder Finnianus
said, "Nay; a fitting name for him is '<i>Leth n-Eirenn</i>'
(Half-Ireland); for his parish shall be extended
through the middle of Ireland." This prophecy excited
much envy against Saint Kiaranus.</p>

<br />
<h4>XXIII. THE BLESSING OF CIARAN'S FOOD</h4>
<p>
<b>19.</b> On another day, when Saint Kiaranus was alone
in his cell, he came to table to take food; and wishing
to partake after a blessing, he said, "<i>Benedicite.</i>"
When he saw that no one answered "<i>Dominus</i>," he
rose from the table, tasting nothing that day. He did
the like on the following day, still rising from the table
without food. On the third day, after having thus
fasted for three days, he came to table and said, "<i>Benedicite</i>";
and lo, a voice from Heaven said unto him,
"The Lord bless thee, weary Kiaranus; now is thy
prayer full-ripe. For it is enough for a man, whenever
he is alone, to bless his food in the name of the Most
High God, and then to partake." So Saint Kyaranus,
giving thanks, ate his bread on the third day.</p>
<br />
<span class="page"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[page 27]</span>
<h4>XXVI. HOW CIARAN FREED A WOMAN FROM SERVITUDE</h4>
<p>
<b>20.</b> One time he went to the King of Temoria, who
was called Tuathal Mael-gharbh, in that he was harsh,
so that he should set free a woman unjustly held in
servitude with that king. The king released not the
woman to him. Then Saint Kiaranus blessed her, and
bade her go with him to her own people. So she forthwith
rose out of the house of the king, and made her
way between crowds of men, and none of them saw her
till she came safe to her friends. Regarding this matter
the king and the others marvelled greatly at the
wondrous acts of God.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXVII. HOW CIARAN FREED ANOTHER WOMAN FROM SERVITUDE</h4>
<p>
<b>21.</b> On another occasion Saint Kyaranus entered the
region of a certain lord of the Connachta, that in like
manner he should demand from him a certain woman
who was in unjust servitude to him. As holy Ciaran was
sitting there, lo, three men came with three gifts as an
alms to him; namely, one gifted to him a cow, another a
robe, and a third a frying-pan; and these three gifts did
Ciaran straightway give to the poor who were begging
of him in the presence of the lord. Now in that hour in
lieu of these gifts he received others yet greater in the
presence of the lord; to wit, for the frying-pan a cooking-pot
of three measures, and for the one robe twelve
robes, and for the one cow twelve kine, were gifted to him
by others. Which things Saint Kiaranus sent to other
holy men living hard by. Seeing all these things, that
lord graciously gave the woman free to Saint Kiaranus,
and she went forth to her own people, rejoicing and giving
thanks.</p>
<br />
<span class="page"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[page 28]</span>
<h4>XXXII. CIARAN IN ARAN</h4>
<p>
<b>22.</b> After these things Saint Kiaranus made his way to
an island by name Ara, which is in the ocean westward
beyond Ireland a certain space. And that same island is
ever peopled from <a name="one3r" id="one3r"></a>Ireland,<a href="#one3"><sup>3</sup></a> and in it dwell a multitude of
holy men, and countless saints lie there unknown to all
save only to God Omnipotent. Now for many days
did Saint Kyranus dwell in hard service, under the most
holy Abbot Henna, and great miracles were manifested
by him, and works of holiness are still there related.
Now when Saint Kiaranus was there, he saw this marvellous
vision&mdash;a like vision Saint Enna also saw&mdash;to
wit, a great and fruitful tree on the bank of the river
Synna in the middle of Ireland, whose shadow was
protecting Ireland on every side; and its branches
were flowing beyond Ireland into the sea. On the following
day Saint Kiaranus related that vision to Saint
Enna, which holy Father Enna forthwith interpreted,
saying; "That fruitful tree which thou hast seen, and
which I likewise have seen, thou art it, my son, who
shalt be great before God and man. Thine honour shall
fill Ireland, and the helpful <a name="one4r" id="one4r"></a>shade<a href="#one4"><sup>4</sup></a> of thy dutifulness and
grace shall protect her from demons, plagues, and perils,
and thy fruit shall be for a profit to many far and wide.
Therefore at the decree of God go thou without delay
to the place wherein thy resurrection shall be, which shall
be shown thee of God, so that thou mayest be for a profit
to many." And there Saint Kiaranus was consecrated
priest; and afterwards, at the command of holy Father
Enna, and with the prayer and benediction of him and
of all the saints that were in the island of Ara, Saint
Kiaranus came to Ireland.</p>
<br />
<span class="page"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[page 29]</span>
<h4>XXXIV. HOW CIARAN VISITED SENAN</h4>
<p>
<b>23.</b> One day when Saint Ciaran was making a journey,
there met him a poor man in the way, who begged of
him something in alms; and holy Ciaran gave him his
cloak, and he himself went on afterwards in his under-garment
only. His journey led him to the island of
Cathi which is in the entrance of the ocean to the west,
in the estuary of Luimnech between the territories of
Kiarraighe and of Corco Baiscind: wherein was the most
holy senior Senanus, who first dwelt in that island.
For a venomous and most hurtful monster had alone
possessed that island from ancient times, which holy
Senanus, by the power of God, had driven far from
thence unto a certain lake; and to-day there is a shining
and holy settlement in that island, in honour of Saint
Senanus. Now when Saint Kiaranus was approaching
that island of Cathi, Saint Senanus foresaw in the spirit
his coming and his nakedness: and he sent a ship to
bear him to the island, while he himself, taking a cloak
secretly in his hands, went out to meet him at the
island's harbour. Now when most blessed Senanus saw
Saint Kyaranus coming to him, in an under-garment,
he chid him sportively, saying, "Is it not shame that a
presbyter should walk in a sole under-garment, without
a cowl?" To him, Saint Kiaranus, smiling, said,
"This my nakedness shall soon receive its alleviation,
for there is a cloak for me under the vesture of mine
elder Senanus." And Saint Kiaranus remained for some
days with Saint Senanus, they passing the time in the
divine mysteries; and they made a pact and a brotherhood
between them, and thereafter Saint Kiaranus
with the kiss of peace went his way.</p><br />
<span class="page"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[page 30]</span>

<h4>XXXV. CIARAN IN ISEL</h4>
<p>
<b>24.</b> Now when blessed Kiaranus came from Saint
Senanus, he went out to his brethren Luchennus and
Odranus, who were living in a <i>cella</i> which is called Yseal,
that is "the lowest place"; and he lived with them for
a time. And his brethren made Saint Kiaranus their
almoner and guest-master: but Luchennus, who was
the eldest, was the abbot of that place, and Odranus was
the prior. Once, when Saint Kiaranus was reading out
of doors in a field facing the sun, he suddenly espied
weary guests entering the guest-house; and rising quickly,
he forgot his book, and left it out of doors open till the
following day. As he himself was settling the guests
in the house, washing their feet and diligently ministering
to them, the night fell. In that very night there was a
great rain, but by the favour of God the open book was
found perfectly dry; for not a drop of rain had touched
it, although the whole ground was wet around it.
For this did Saint Kiaranus with his brethren render
praises to Christ.</p>

<br />
<h4>XXXVI. THE REMOVAL OF THE LAKE</h4>
<p>
<b>25.</b> Near that place of Saint Kiaranus there was an
island in a lake, on which a certain lord was dwelling
in his fortress with his followers; and the noise of their
uproar was hindering the prayers of the holy men in
their <i>cella</i>. When Saint Kyeranus saw this, he went
out to the shore of the lake, and prayed there to the
Lord, that He would give them somewhat of relief
from that island. On the following night that island,
with its lake, was removed by the divine power, far away
to another place, where the noise of the mob of that
island could not reach the saints of God. And unto
this day there is to be seen the place of the lake, where<span class="page"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[page 31]</span>
it had been before, some of it sandy, some of it marshy,
as a sign of the act of power.</p>

<br />
<h4>XXXVII. CIARAN DEPARTS FROM ISEL</h4>
<p>
<b>26.</b> On a certain day when Ciaran was busied out of
doors in a field, a poor man came to him, asking that an
alms should be given him. In that hour a chariot with
two horses was gifted to Saint Kiaranus by a certain
lord, namely the son of Crimthannus; which horses with
the chariot Saint Kiaranus gave to that poor man.</p>
<p>
Then, since the brethren of Saint Kiaranus could not
endure the greatness of his charity, for every day he
was dividing their substance among the poor, they said
unto him, "Brother, depart from us; we cannot now be
along with thee in one place, and preserve and nourish
our brethren for God, for thine excess of charity." To
whom holy Kiaranus answered: "If therefore I had
remained in this place, it would not have been 'Ysseal,'
that is, 'lowest,' that is, not small; but high, that
is, great and <a name="one5r" id="one5r"></a>honourable."<a href="#one5"><sup>5</sup></a> With these words, holy
Kiaranus gave a blessing to his brethren, and taking
his book-satchels with his books on his shoulders, he<span class="page"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[page 32]</span>
went thence on his way.</p>
<p>
When he had gone some little distance from the
place, there met him in the way a stag awaiting him
with utmost gentleness. Saint Kiaranus placed his book-satchels
upon him, and wheresoever the stag would
go, Saint Kieranus followed him. The stag came to
Loch Rii which is in the east of Connachta; he stood
over against Inis Angin, which is in that lake. Thereby
Saint Kyaranus understood that the Lord had called
him to that island, and dismissing the stag with a
blessing he entered that island and dwelt there.</p>

<br />
<h4>XXXVIII. CIARAN IN INIS AINGHIN</h4>
<p>
<b>27.</b> Now when the fame of his holiness was noised
abroad, from far and wide and from every quarter good
men came together to him, and Saint Kiaranus made
them his monks. And many alms, in respect of various
matters, would be given to Saint Kiaranus and to his
people by the Faithful. But a certain presbyter, by name
Daniel, who owned Inis Angin, inspired by the devil's
envy, set about expelling Saint Kyaranus with his
followers by force from the island. But Saint Kiaranus,
wishing to benefit his persecutor, sent him by faithful
messengers a royal gift which had been given him in
alms, namely a golden <i>antilum</i>, well adorned. When
the presbyter saw it, at first he refused to accept it;
but afterwards, on the persuasion of trustworthy men, he
received it gratefully. And presbyter Daniel, filled with
the grace of God, came and gifted Inis Angin which was
in his possession, to God and to Saint Kiaranus for ever.</p>

<br />
<h4>XXXIX. THE COMING OF OENNA</h4>
<p>
<b>28.</b> On another day when Saint Kiaranus was in that
island Angin, he heard the voice of a man in the port
wishing to enter the island; and he said to his brethren,<span class="page"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[page 33]</span>
"Go ye, my brethren, and lead me hither him who is
to be your abbot after me." So the brethren, voyaging
quickly, found an unconsecrated youth in the port, whom
despising they left there. Coming back, they said unto
Saint Kiaranus, "We found no man there save an unconsecrated
youth, who wandered as a fugitive in the woods;
he it is who calleth in the port. Far removed from abbotship
is <i>his</i> rudeness!" To these Saint Kiaranus said:
"Voyage ye without delay and bring him with speed;
for the Lord having revealed it to me, by his voice I
have recognised that he shall be your abbot after me."
When the brethren heard this, they forthwith led him in,
and Saint Kiaranus tonsured him, and he read diligently
with him, and was filled from day to day with the
grace of God; and after the most blessed Kiaranus,
he was the holy abbot. For he is the blessed Aengus,
son of Luigse.</p>
<br />

<h4>XL. HOW CIARAN RECOVERED HIS GOSPEL</h4>
<p>
<b>29.</b> The gospel-book of Saint Kieranus fell into the
lake from the hand of one of the brethren, who held it
carelessly when voyaging. For a long time it was therein,
under the water, and was not found. But on a certain
day, in summer, the kine entered the lake to refresh
themselves in the waters, for the greatness of the heat;
and when the kine had returned from the lake, the
binding of the leather satchel containing the gospel-book
caught about the hoof of a cow, and so the cow
dragged the book-satchel on her hoof as she came to
land. And the gospel-book was found in the rotten
leather satchel, perfectly dry and clean, without any
moisture, as though it had been preserved in a book-case.
Saint Kiaranus with his followers were rejoiced
thereat.</p>
<br />
  <span class="page"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[page 34]</span>
<h4>XLI. HOW CIARAN WENT FROM INIS AINGIN TO CLONMACNOIS</h4>
<p>
<b>30.</b> After this a certain man of Mumonia, to wit of the
people of Corco Baiscind, by name Donnanus, came to
Saint Ciaran as he sojourned in Inis Angin. To him
one day Saint Kiaranus said, "What seekest thou,
father, in these coasts?" Saint Donnanus answered,
"Lord, I seek a place wherein to sojourn, where I may
serve Christ in pilgrimage." Saint Kiaranus said to
him, "Sojourn, father, in this place; for I shall go to
some other place, for I know that here is not my
resurrection."</p>
<p>
Then Saint Kyaranus granted Inis Angin with its
furniture to Saint Donnanus, and came to a place which
is called Ard Mantain, near the river Sinna; but being
unwilling to remain in that place, he said: "I will not
live in this place: for here shall be great abundance of
the things of this life, and earthly joy; and hardly
could the souls of my disciples attain to heaven, were I
to have dwelt here, for this place belongs to the men
of this world."</p>
<p>
Thereafter Saint Kiaranus left that place, and came
to a place which once was called Typrait, but now is
called Cluain meic Nois. And coming to this place he
said: "Here will I live: for many souls shall go forth
in this place to the kingdom of God, and in this place
shall be my resurrection."</p>
<p>
Then most blessed Kiaranus with his followers dwelt,
and began to found a great monastery there. And many
from all sides used to come to him, and his parish was
extended over a great circuit; and the name of Saint
Kiaranus was much renowned over all Ireland. And
a shining and holy settlement, the name of which is
Cluain meic Nois, grew up in that place in honour of Saint
Kiaranus; it is in the western border of the land of <span class="page"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[page 35]</span>
Ui Neill, on the eastern bank of the river Synna, over
against the province of the Connachta. Therein are
the kings or the lords of Ui Neill and of the Connachta
buried, along with Saint Kiaranus. For the river
Synna, which is very rich in various fish, divides the
regions of Niall, that is, of Midhe, and the province of
the Connachta.</p>

<br />
<h4>XLII. THE FOUNDATION OF THE CHURCH</h4>
<p>
<b>31.</b> And when Saint Kiaranus would place with his
own hands a corner-post in the first building of that
settlement, a certain wizard said to him: "This hour
is not good for beginning; for the sign of this hour
is contrary to beginnings of building." Then Saint
Kiaranus himself set the post in the corner of the house,
saying, "Thou wizard, against thy sign I fix this post
in the ground; for I care naught for the art of wizards,
but in the name of my Lord, Jesus Christ, do I all my
works." For this the wizard and his followers uttered
commendation, marvelling at the faith of Saint Ciaran
in his God.</p>

<br />
<h4>XLIII. HOW CIARAN SENT A CLOAK TO SENAN</h4>
<p>
<b>32.</b> Now when Saint Kiaranus had been in his settlement
of Cluain meic Nois, an excellent cloak was gifted
to him in alms by a certain man. Saint Kyaranus was
minded to send it to the aforesaid holy elder Senanus,
who dwelt in the island of Cathi; but he was not able
immediately to find a messenger, because the way from
the settlement of Saint Kiaranus of Cluain meic Nois,
which is in the middle of Ireland, to the island of Cathi,
situate at the entrance of the ocean, was long and<span class="page"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[page 36]</span>
rough and difficult, and crossed borders of different
kingdoms. Then at the command of Saint Kiaranus,
the cloak was placed on the river Synna, and was sent
alone with the river, and it came dry over the waters
to the island of Cathi; and no one saw it while it
travelled thither. The Synna flows from the settlement
of Cluain meic Nois to the estuary of Luimnech,
in which the island of Cathi stands.</p>
<p>
And Saint Senanus, filled with the spirit of prophecy,
said to his brethren, "Go ye to the shore of the sea, and
bring to us with honour the guest there seated, the gift
of a man of God." And the brethren, asking no questions,
made their way to the sea, and found there the
cloak, perfectly dry, for it was untouched by the waters.
And the holy elder Senanus accepting it, gave thanks
to God; and the cloak was in honourable keeping with
Saint Senanus, as though it were a sacred diadem.</p>

<br />
<h4>XLV. THE STORY OF CRITHIR</h4>
<p>
<b>33.</b> A certain boy of the company of holy Kiaranus,
called Crithir of Cluain (a boy of great wit, but hurtful
and wanton) fled from Saint Kiaranus to the settlement
of Saigyr, in the northern border of Mumonia,
that is, the land of Hele, to the other Kiaranus, the most
holy aged bishop. And that boy, sojourning for some
days with the holy bishop, after his devilish manner
took the drink of the brethren, and poured it over the
fire; extinguishing thus the consecrated fire. Now Saint
Kiaranus the elder would have no other fire in his
monastery save the consecrated fire, maintained without
being extinguished from Easter to Easter. When
Saint Kiaranus the elder heard what the boy Crithir
did, it greatly displeased him, and he said, "Let him
be chastened for this of God in this life." When he<span class="page"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[page 37]</span>
heard that Saint Kiaranus the elder was angry with him,
he went out from the settlement of Saigyr, and when he
was gone a short space from the settlement, wolves met
him and killed him; yet they did not touch his body
after he was dead, after the likeness of that prophet
who was killed by the lion.</p>
<p>
Now when Saint Kiaranus the younger heard that his
boy had been with Kiaranus the elder, he went to him;
and on the day when the aforesaid things took place,
he came to the settlement of Saigyr and was received
with fitting honour by the holy bishop Kiaranus the
elder. And the holy abbot Kiaranus the younger said
to the holy bishop Kiaranus, "Restore to me, holy
father, my disciple alive, who hath been slain while
with thee." To him Saint Keranus the elder said,
"First needs must your feet be washed, but we have no
fire in the monastery, to warm the water for you; and
ye know that it is because your disciple quenched our
sacred fire. Wherefore beseech for us consecrated fire
from God." Then the holy abbot Kieranus the younger,
son of the wright, stretched his hands in prayer to God,
and straightway fire from heaven came into his breast,
and thence was the hearth kindled in the monastery.</p>
<p>
But the holy bishop Kiaranus the elder prayed to
God for that youth slain by wolves, and straightway he
arose sound from a cruel death, with the scars of the wolf-bites
visible upon him. And blessing them all, he took
food and drink with the saints, and afterwards he
lived many days.</p>
<p>
Then the two Saints Kiaranus made a compact and
brotherhood in heaven and in earth between their
successors; and they said that should any wish to name
or to beg aught for one of them, he should name them
both and ask, for they would hear him.</p>
<p>
After this the holy abbot Kiaranus the younger said <span class="page"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[page 38]</span>
to the bishop, Kiaranus the elder, "In thy place, father,
shall remain honour and abundance of riches." To
him said the holy bishop, Kiaranus the elder, "Also in
thy place, dearest son, shall last the strength of religion
and of wisdom, unto the end of the world." When these
things were said, having received the kiss of peace and
blessing of the most holy bishop, Kiaranus the elder,
Saint Kiaranus the younger with his own people and
with the aforesaid youth Crithir returned to his settlement
of Cluain meic Nois.</p>

<br />
<h4>XLIV. CIARAN AND THE WlNE</h4>
<p>
<b>34.</b> On a certain day when the brethren of Saint
Kiaranus were at work in the harvest, enduring thirst
from the heat of the sun, they sent word that cold water
should be brought to them. Saint Kiaranus answered
them by a messenger, "Choose ye, my brethren, whether
ye will drink to quench your thirst for necessity, or
will endure in thirst till the evening, that through your
labour to-day in thirst and in sweat there may be
abundance for the brethren who are to be in this place
hereafter; and you yourselves will not fail of reward
from God in heaven." The brethren answered, "We
choose that there be a sufficiency for our successors,
and we to have the reward of our patience and of our
thirst in heaven." So the brethren worked that day
athirst, rejoicing, though the sun was hot.</p>
<p>
But when evening was come, the brethren returned
home, and Saint Kiaranus wished to satisfy them, and
to refresh them charitably. And trusting in the Lord,
he blessed a great vessel full of water; and immediately
under his hands wine of most excellent quality appeared
in the vessel. And bringing drinking-cups, he commanded
the brethren to refresh their bodies well, with<span class="page"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[page 39]</span>
sobriety, rendering thanks to Christ for his gifts.</p>
<p>
This is the Last Supper of Saint Ciaran with his
brethren in his life, he himself ministering unto them;
for he lived thereafter but few days. And that supper
was most generous, excelling all the suppers that were
made in the monastery of Saint Kiaranus, as is proved
thus&mdash;</p>
<p>
For after a long time, when Saint Columba with his
followers had come to Ireland from the island of Hia,
a great feast was prepared for them in the monastery
of Saint Kiaranus in his settlement of Cluain; and
when they had come to the religious house of Saint
Kiaranus, they were received with great joy and love,
and were refreshed most bounteously with that repast;
and the fame of that supper went over the whole
settlement and its suburbs, far and wide.</p>
<p>
When, in the house of the holy elders, who had a
little cell apart in the monastery of Saint Kiaranus,
certain persons said in ignorance that never in that
place had such a feast been made, nor would be in the
future, one, who had been a boy when Saint Kiaranus
lived there, answered: "Ye know not whereat ye wonder:
for the feast which Saint Kiaranus our patron made, of
water turned to wine, for his brethren athirst after
harvesting, was far better than this feast. And that
ye may know this, and may believe that it is true,
come and perceive the odour of my finger with which I
drew of that wine for the brethren. For my thumb
touched the liquor through the mouth of the cup in
which the wine was drawn; and lo, even yet its odour
remains thereupon." Then they all drew near, and
being sated with the pleasant and sweet odour of that
holy elder, they cried aloud saying, "Truly much better
was that feast whose odour remains on a finger most
sweet for so long a time." And they blessed Saint<span class="page"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[page 40]</span>
Kiaranus, giving praises to God.</p>
<p>
And in those days, in which the brethren of Saint
Kiaranus were sowing their crops, there came merchants
with wine of the Gauls to Saint Kiaranus, and they
filled a huge vessel, the <i>solitana</i> of the brethren, from
that wine, which Saint Kiaranus gave to his brethren
with his benediction.</p>

<br />
<h4>XLIX. THE DEATH OF CIARAN</h4>
<p>
<b>35.</b> Our most holy patron Kiaranus lived but for one
year in his settlement of Cluain. When he knew that
the day of his death was approaching, he prophesied,
deploring the subsequent evils that would come to pass
in his place after him; and he said that their life would
be short. Then the brethren said unto him, "What
then shall we do in the time of those evils? Shall we
abide here beside thy relics, or shall we go to other
places?" To them Saint Kiaranus said, "Haste ye
to other quiet places, and leave my relics here like the
dry bones of a stag on a mountain. For it is better for
you to be with my spirit in heaven than beside my bones
on earth, and stumbling withal."</p>
<p>
Saint Kiaranus used greatly to crucify his body, and
we write here an example of this. He ever had a stone
pillow beneath his head, which till to-day remains in
the monastery of Saint Kiaranus, and is reverenced by
every one. Moreover, when he was growing weak, he
would not have the stone removed from him, but commanded
it to be placed to his shoulders, that he should
have affliction even to the end, for the sake of an
everlasting reward in heaven.</p>
<p>
Now when the hour of his departure was approaching,
he commanded that he should be carried outside, out
of the house; and looking up into heaven, he said,<span class="page"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[page 41]</span>
"Hard is that <a name="one6r" id="one6r"></a>way,<a href="#one6"><sup>6</sup></a> and this needs must be." To him
the brethren said, "We know that nothing is difficult
for thee, father; but we unhappy ones must greatly fear
this hour."</p>
<p>
And being carried back into the house, he raised his
hand and blessed his people and clerks; and having
received the Lord's Sacrifice, on the fifth of the ides of
September he gave up the ghost, in the thirty-third
year of his age. And lo, angels filled the way between
heaven and earth, rejoicing to meet Saint Kiaranus.</p>

<br />
<h4>L. THE VISIT OF COEMGEN</h4>
<p>
<b>36.</b> And on the third night after the death of Saint
Kiaranus, the most holy abbot Coemhgenus came from
the province of the Lagenians to the burial of Saint
Kiaranus; and Saint Kiaranus spake with Saint
Coemhgenus and they exchanged their vesture, and
they made a perpetual brotherhood between themselves
and their followers. This is related faithfully and at
length in the Life of Coemhgenus himself.</p>
<br />

<h4>LI. THE EARTH OF CIARAN'S TOMB DELIVERS COLUM CILLE FROM A WHIRLPOOL</h4>
<p>
<b>37.</b> Saint Columba, on hearing of the death of Saint
Kiaranus, said, "Blessed be God, Who hath called to
Himself most holy Kiaranus from this life in his youth.
For had he lived to old age, there would have been envy
of many against him, for he would have had a firm hold
on the parish of all Ireland."</p>
<p>
Saint Columba made a hymn to Saint Kiaranus;<span class="page"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[page 42]</span>
and when he set it forth in the settlement of Cluain,
the successor of Saint Kiaranus said unto him, "Shining
and worthy of praise is this hymn; what reward then,
father, shall be rendered unto thee?" Saint Columba
answered: "Give me my hands full of the earth of the
grave of your holy father Kiaranus; for I wish for and
desire that, more than for pure gold and precious gems."
And Saint Columba receiving earth from the grave of
Saint Kiaranus, made his way to his own island of Hya.</p>
<p>
When Saint Columba was voyaging on the sea, there
arose a storm in the sea, and the ship was thrust towards
the whirlpool which is in the Scotic tongue called Cori
Bracayn, in which is a sea-whirlpool most dangerous,
wherein if ships enter they come not out. And the whirlpool
beginning to draw the ship towards itself, blessed
Columba cast part of the earth of Saint Kiaranus into
the sea. Most wondrous to relate, immediately the
storm of the air, the movement of the waves, and the
swirl of the whirlpool all ceased, till the ship had long
escaped from it. Then Saint Columba, giving thanks
to God, said to his followers, "Ye see, brethren, how
much favour hath the earth of most blessed Kiaranus
brought us."</p>

<br />
<h4>LIII. A PANEGYRIC OF CIARAN</h4>
<p>
<b>38.</b> Most blessed Kiaranus living among men passed
a life as of an angel, for the grace of the Holy Spirit
burned in his face before the eyes of men. Who could
expound his earthly converse? For he was young in
age and in body, yet a most holy senior in mind and in
manners, in humility, in gentleness, in charity, in daily
labours, in nightly vigils, and in other divine works.</p>
<p>
For now liveth he in rest without labour, in age
without senility, in health without sorrow, in joy without<span class="page"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[page 43]</span>
grief, in peace without a foe, in wealth without poverty,
in endless day without night, in the eternal kingdom
without end, before the throne of Christ, Who with the
Father and the Holy Spirit liveth and reigneth unto
ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<p>

meic Nois.</i></p>

<h2>THE SECOND LATIN LIFE OF SAINT CIARAN</h2>
<br /><br />
<h4>II. THE ORIGIN AND BIRTH OF CIARAN</h4>
<p>
<b>1.</b> A glorious man; and an abbot in life most holy,
Queranus, was born of a father Boecius, of a mother
Darercha. This man drew his origin from the northern
part of Ireland, that is, he was of the Aradenses by race.
Now he was so illuminated by divine grace from his
boyhood, that it was clearly apparent of what manner
he was destined to be. For he was as a burning lamp
in extraordinary charity, so as to show not only the
warmth of a pious heart and devotion in relieving the
necessity of men, but also an unwearied sympathy for
the needs of irrational animals. And because such a
lamp should not be hidden under a bushel, so from his
boyhood he began to sparkle with the marvels of miracles.</p>
<br />

<h4>III. HOW CIARAN RAISED THE STEED OF OENGUS FROM
DEATH</h4>
<p>
<b>2.</b> For when the horse of the son of the king of that
territory perished with a sudden death, and the young
man was much grieved at its fall, there appeared to him
in dreams a man of venerable and shining countenance,
who forbade him to be grieved for the death of the horse,
saying unto him, "Call," said he, "the holy boy Keranus,
and let him pour water into the mouth of thy horse,
and sprinkle its forehead, and it shall revive. And thou
shalt endow him with due reward for its resurrection."</p>
<p>
When the king's son had wakened from sleep, he sent<span class="page"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[page 45]</span>
for the boy Keranus that he should come to him; who,
when he made his presence known, and heard the
dream throughout, according to what the angel taught
him, sprinkled the horse with holy water and raised it
from death. When this great miracle was seen, the
king of that territory made over to Saint Keranus a
fertile and spacious field in honour of Omnipotent God,
in Whose Name his horse was resurrected.</p>
<br />

<h4>IV. HOW CIARAN TURNED WATER INTO HONEY</h4>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Moreover it fell out on a certain day that the
mother of Keranus himself found fault with him, for
that he did not bring wild honey such as the other boys
were wont to carry to their parents. When the beloved
of God and men heard this, he raised his thoughts to
the Boy who was subject to His parents, and blessed
water, brought from a neighbouring spring, in His Name
who is able to draw honey from the rock, and oil from
the hardest stone; and presently that water is changed,
with the help of God, into the sweetest honey, and so
it is brought to his mother. This honey his parents
sent to Saint Dermicius the deacon, surnamed Iustus,
who baptized him.</p>
<br />

<h4>XVII. HOW CIARAN WENT WITH HIS COW TO THE
SCHOOL OF FINDIAN</h4>
<p>
<b>4.</b> Now when the rudiments of letters had been read
[with him] by the saint aforesaid, he proposed to go to
the blessed abbey of Cluayn Hirard for instruction.
And as he wished to fulfil in deed what he had begun to
conceive of in his mind, he asked a cow of his parents
for his sustenance. But when his mother would not
grant his petition, the Heavenly Father, Who loveth<span class="page"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[page 46]</span>
those whom He regardeth as a mother her son, did not
tarry to fulfil the desire of his beloved. For a milch cow,
together with her calf, followed him as though she had
been driven after him by her herdsman.</p>
<p>
When he had come to the sacred college of Saint
Fynnianus, they all had no small joy at his arrival.
But the cow, which had followed him, was pastured
along with her calf, nor did it [the calf] attempt to touch
the udders of its mother without permission. Keranus
so separated and divided its pastures, that the mother
would only lick the calf, and would not offer to suckle it.
Now the milk of that cow was rich in such abundance
that, divided daily, it would supply a sufficiency of
provision for twelve men.</p>
<p>
But the holy youth Keranus, deeply occupied with the
sacred Scripture, shone in holiness and wisdom among
his fellow-students as a brilliant star among the other
stars. For he was filled with the fragrance of perfect
charity, with moral worth, with holiness of life, and
with sweetness of humility, gracious, honourable, and
admirable to present and to absent.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXVI. HOW CIARAN FREED A WOMAN FROM
SERVITUDE</h4>
<p>
<b>5.</b> One day he made his way to a king, Tuathlus by
name, to intercede for the liberation of a certain bond-maid.
When he besought the king fervently for
her, and <i>he</i> rejected the prayers of the servant of
God as though they were ravings, he thought out a
new method of liberating her, and determined that he
himself should serve the king in her place. Now when
he was coming to the house in which the girl was
grinding, the doors which were shut opened to him.
Entering, he showed himself a second Bishop Paulinus<span class="page"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[page 47]</span>
to her. Without delay the king freed her, and further
presented his vesture to the servant of God. Receiving
this, he forthwith distributed it to the poor.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXIV. THE STORY OF THE MILL AND THE BAILIFF'S
DAUGHTER<br />
<span style="font-size:0.9em;"><i>(abstract only)</i></span></h4>
<p>
<b>6.</b> It fell out one night that the eminent doctor
Finnianus sent him with grain of wheat to the mill.
Now a certain kingling who lived near, learning that
one of the disciples of the man of God had come thither,
sent him flesh and ale by a servant. When they had
presented the gift of such a man, he answered, "That it
may be common," said he, "to the brethren, cast it all
on the surface of the mill." When the messenger had
done this, it was all turned into wheat. When he heard
this, the king gave him the steading in which he was
dwelling, with all his goods, in perpetuity:  but Keranus
made it over to his master, for a monastery was afterwards
erected there. But the bread made of that grain
tasted to the brethren like flesh and ale, and so it
refreshed them.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ROBBERS OF LOCH
ERNE</h4>
<p>
<b>7.</b> Now when a space of time had passed, the licence
and benediction of his master having been obtained,
he made his way to Saint Nynnidus who was dwelling
in a wood <i>(sic)</i> of Loch Erny. Now when he had
arrived he was received with great joy and unfeigned
love. As he was daily becoming perfect in the discipline
of manners and of virtue, on a certain day, as one truly
obedient, he went forth to the groves hard by with
brethren to cut timber. For it was a custom in that
sacred college, that three monks, with an elder, always<span class="page"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[page 48]</span>
went out in prescribed order to transport timber. As
the others were cutting wood, he by himself, as was
his wont, was intent on prayer to God. Meanwhile
certain wicked robbers, ferried over in a boat to that
island, fell upon the aforesaid brethren and slew them,
and bore away their heads. But Keranus, not hearing
the sound of his companions hacking, was surprised,
and in wonder he hurried to the place where he had left
them labouring. When he saw what had been done to
the brethren he heaved heavy sighs and was deeply
grieved; and he followed the murderers by their track,
and found them in the harbour, sweating to carry their
boat in the harbour to the water, but unable to do so.
For God so fastened their skiff to the land that by no
means could they remove it. So being unable to resist
the will of the All-Powerful, they beseech as suppliants
pardon of the man of God, then present. Mindful
of his Master as He prayed for the Jews who were
crucifying Him, he, a holy one, poured forth prayers for
them, unworthy as they were, to the Fount of Piety;
and strengthened by the virtue of his prayer, they were
able to convey their boat quite easily to the water.
In payment for this benefit he obtained from the robbers
the heads of his brethren. When he had received these,
he made his way back to the place where their bodies
had been lying, and fervently asked of God to show forth
His omnipotence in the resuscitation of His servants
in this life. Wondrous is what I relate, but in the truth
of fact most manifest. He fitted the heads to the bodies,
and recalled them to life by the virtue of the holy
prayer&mdash;nay, rather, what is more correct, he obtained
their recall. These, thus marvellously resuscitated, bore
timber back to the monastery. But so long as they
lived they bore the scars of the wounds on their necks.</p><br />

<span class="page"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[page 49]</span>
<h4>IX. HOW CIARAN RESTORED A CALF WHICH A WOLF
HAD DEVOURED</h4>
<p>
<b>8.</b> At another time when he was keeping the herds of
his parents in a certain place, a cow gave birth to a calf
in his presence. But a [hound], altogether wasted with
leanness, came, desiring to fill [his belly] with whatso
falleth from the body of the mother with the calf, and
stood before the dutiful shepherd. To which he said,
"Eat, poor wretch, yonder calf, for great is thy need of
it." The hound, fulfilling the commands of Queranus,
devoured the calf down to the bones. But as Queranus
returned with the kine to the house, that one, recalling
her calf to memory, was running hither and thither,
lowing; and the mother of Queranus, recognising the
cause of the lowing, said with indignation to the boy,
"Quiranus, restore the calf, though it be burnt with fire
or drowned with water." But he, obeying his mother's
commands, making his way to the place where the calf
had been devoured, collected its bones and resuscitated
the calf.</p>


<h4>V. HOW CIARAN WAS DELIVERED FROM A HOUND</h4>
<p>
<b>9.</b> At a certain time, when he was passing along a
road, certain men spurred by a malignant spirit incited
a most savage dog to do him a hurt. But Queranus,
trusting in his Lord, fortified himself with the shield of
devout prayer, and said, "Deliver not to beasts the souls
of them that trust in Thee, O Lord": and soon that
dog died.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXXI. HOW CIARAN FLOATED A FIREBRAND ON THE
LAKE</h4>
<p>
<b>10.</b> At another time when he was left alone in that
island, he heard a poor man in the harbour asking that
fire be given to him. For it was now the time of cold:<span class="page"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[page 50]</span>
but he had no boat whereby to satisfy the petition of
the poor man, though much he desired to do so. And
because charity suffereth all things, he cast a burning
firebrand into the lake, and the heat of love that sent
it prevailing over the waters, it came to the poor man.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXXII. CIARAN IN ARAN</h4>
<p>
<b>11.</b> Now when the man of God had spent a certain
time there, with the licence of Nynnidus he hastened
to Saint Endeus, abbot in Ara; who was filled with no
small joy at his coming. Now on a certain night he
dreamed that he had seen beside the bank of the great
river Synan a great leafy and fruitful tree which over-shadowed
all Ireland. Which dream he related to
blessed Endeus on the following day. But Endeus
himself bore witness that he had seen the same vision
that night, which vision Endeus interpreted: "The
tree," he said, "thou art it, who shalt be great before
God and men, and honourable throughout all Ireland;
because she is protected from demons and from other
perils by the shadow of thy help and grace, as under
the shadow of a health-giving tree. Many near and
far shall the fruit of thy works advantage. Wherefore
according to the decree of God who revealeth secrets,
depart to the place that hath been shown thee before,
and there abide, according to the grace given thee of
God." Comforted by the interpretation of this vision,
in true obedience he obeyed the command of Saint
Endeus his spiritual father.</p>

<h4>XXXIV. HOW CIARAN VISITED SENAN</h4>
<p>
<b>12.</b> And having set forth on the way he found in his
journey a poor man, to whom, as he asked an alms of
him, he made over his cloak. And when he had arrived<span class="page"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[page 51]</span>
at the island of Cathacus, blessed Senanus learnt of his
arrival, the Spirit revealing it to him, and coming to
meet him he said as though smiling, "Is it not shame
for a presbyter to journey without a cloak?" For
Senanus in the spirit knew how he had given it to a poor
man. And so he came to meet him with a cloak. And
Keranus said, "My elder," said he, "beareth a cloak for
me under his vesture."</p>
<br />

<h4>XXXV. CIARAN IN ISEL</h4>
<p>
<b>13.</b> When he had received it and returned thanks to
the giver, he came for sacred converse to the cell of his
brother Luctigernnus, where also was his other brother,
Odranus by name. There for some time he prolonged
his sojourn, and was guest-master. Now one day when
he was reading in the open air in the cemetery, guests
came unexpectedly, whom he led to the guest-house,
having left his book open in forgetfulness: and he washed
their feet with devotion, and did the other services
necessary for them, for the sake of Christ. Meanwhile,
when the night darkness had fallen, there was a great
rain. But He Who bedewed the fleece of Gideon, but
afterwards kept it untouched by the dew, so preserved
the book of holy Keranus, open though it was, from
the rushing waters, that not a drop fell upon it.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXXVI. THE REMOVAL OF THE LAKE</h4>
<p>
<b>14.</b> Near to the monastery in which the man of God
was then staying, there was an island, which certain
worldly men inhabited, whose uproar used greatly to
disturb the men of God. Whence it happened that
blessed Keranus, compelled by their disquietude, made
his way to the lake, and giving himself up wholly to
prayer, succeeded in obtaining the removal of those who<span class="page"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[page 52]</span>
were distressing the servants of God. For when he
ceased from prayer, behold, suddenly the island with the
lake and the inhabitants withdrew to a remote place,
so that by no means could its inhabitants disturb the
friends of the Most High. For this miracle was done in
His Name Who overturned Sodom on account of the sin
of its inhabitants, and consumed it with fire. The traces
of that lake, where it formerly was, still exist.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXXVIII. CIARAN IN INIS AINGIN</h4>
<p>
<b>15.</b> As the man of God was distributing the goods of
the monastery for the use of the poor, his brethren
complaining of this and coming to him inconsiderately,
said, "Depart," said they, "from us, for we cannot live
together." To whom agreeing, and bidding farewell
in the Lord, he transferred himself to an island by name
Angina. A monastery having been founded in this
island, many hastening from all sides, attracted by the
fame of his holiness, submitted to the service of God.
Ordering them under strict rules, by face and by habit,
by speech and by life, he showed himself as an example
to them. For he was as an eagle inciting its young to
fly, in respect to sublimity of contemplation; but he
lived as the least of them in brotherly humility. For
he was in spiritual meditations attached to the highest
things; yet so much did he stoop to feeble weakness
that he seemed as though he tended towards the lowliest
things. He was also perfect in faith, fervent in charity,
rejoicing in hope, gentle of heart, courteous of speech,
patient and long-suffering, kindly in hospitality, ever
diligent in works of piety, benign, gentle, peaceful,
sober, and quiet. To summarise many things in one
short sentence, he was garnished with the ornament of
all the virtues. Expending a care zealous for these and<span class="page"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[page 53]</span>
the like matters&mdash;the care of Mary for contemplation,
and of Martha for the dispensing of things temporal&mdash;he
fulfilled his duty in ordered succession. Nor could the
light of such and so great a lantern be hidden under a
bushel: but it glittered with light, all around, wheresoever
it abundantly illuminated the world with the
outpoured glory of its grace.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXXIX. THE COMING OF OENNA</h4>
<p>
<b>16.</b> He was nevertheless inspired with a spirit of
prophecy, which appears from the preceding and the
following examples. For on a certain day the voice of
one asking for ferrying had struck on his ears. Then
he said to the brethren, "I hear," said he, "the voice of
him whom God will set over you as abbot. Go, therefore,
and fetch him." So they hastened; and coming to
the harbour, they found an unlettered youth. Not caring
to lead him to the holy man, they returned and declared
that they had found no one, save an unlettered youth
who was wandering as a vagabond in the woods. But
Saint Queranus said, "Lead him hither," said he,
"and despise not your future pastor." Who being led
in, by the inspiration of God and by the instruction of
the holy man, took on him the habit of religion, and duly
learned his letters. For he is Saint Oenius, a man of
venerable life; and, as the saint prophesied beforehand,
he was duly set over the brethren.</p>
<br />

<h4>XLI. HOW CIARAN WENT FROM INIS AINGHIN TO<br />
CLONMACNOIS</h4>
<p>
<b>17.</b> At length, when some time had passed, a holy
man by name Dompnanus, of Mumonia by race, came
to visit the man of God. When Saint Keranus
enquired of him the cause of his coming, he replied that<span class="page"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[page 54]</span>
he wished to have a place in which he could serve the
Lord in security. But Saint Keranus, seeking not his
own, but the things of Jesus Christ, said, "Here," said
he, "dwell thou, and I with God's guidance shall seek
a place of habitation elsewhere." Finally, the sacred
community accompanying him, he made his way to
the place foreshown him of God, in which, when the
famous and renowned monastery which is to-day
called the city of Cluayn was built, he himself illuminated
the world, like the sun, with the light of famous miracles.</p>
<br />

<h4>XLIV. CIARAN AND THE WINE</h4>
<p>
<b>18.</b> Of the multitude of these miracles we add some
here. One time, when the brethren, labouring in the
harvest, were oppressed with peril of thirst, they sent
to holy Father Queranus that they might be refreshed
by the blessing of water. To these, through the
servants, he said: "Choose ye," said he, "one of two
things; either that ye be now revived with water, or
that those who are to inhabit this place after you be
blessed with the things of this world." But they
answering said: "We choose," said they, "that those
who come after us may abound in temporal goods, and
that we may have the reward of long-suffering in
heaven." And so, rejoicing in the hope of the things
to come, they abstained from drinking, though they
were in great need of it.</p>
<p>
But in the evening when they were returning home,
the tender father, having compassion on the weariness
of the labourers, blessed a vessel filled with water: and
now renewing the holy miracle in Cana of Galilee, he
changed the water into the best wine. By this wine
they, fainting from thirst, were revived; and revived
in faith by the manifestation of an unwonted miracle,<span class="page"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[page 55]</span>
they gave praises to God Almighty. For the taste of
this miraculous wine was more grateful than was wont,
and its odour scented the thumb of the wine-drawer so
long as he survived.</p>
<br />

<h4>XLVI. HOW AN INSULT TO CIARAN WAS AVERTED</h4>
<p>
<b>19.</b> One day when he was going on a way, most
infamous robbers, seizing him, began to shave the head
of the blessed man. But what the frowardness of man
wished to efface, the divine benevolence changed to the
manifestation of a mighty miracle. For in the place of
the shaved hairs other hairs grew forthwith. The
robbers, thrown into consternation by this miracle, were
changed to the way of truth, and at length, serving in
the divine army under so great a leader, they finished
their life in holy conversation.</p>
<br />

<h4>XLVII. HOW CIARAN WAS SAVED FROM SHAME</h4>
<p>
<b>20.</b> At another time when the good shepherd was
feeding his flocks, three poor men met him. To the first
of these he made over his cape, to the second his cloak,
to the third his tunic. But when they were going away
there arrived certain men, leaders of a worldly life. As
he was ashamed to be seen of these without raiment,
the Lord Who helpeth in need so surrounded him with
water that except his head no part of him could they
see. But after these men had passed by the water soon
disappeared.</p>
<br />

<h4>XLVIII. HOW A MAN WAS SAVED FROM ROBBERS</h4>
<p>
<b>21.</b> After this when some time had passed, certain
companions of the devil were trying to slay a man who
dwelt near his monastery: whom, when the blessed man<span class="page"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[page 56]</span>
prayed for him, God marvellously rescued. For when
they were slaughtering the man, they were striking on a
stone statue. The robbers, when at last they perceived
this, being pricked in the heart, hasten to the shepherd
of souls, Queranus: they humbly acknowledge their
crime; and, amending their way of life, they served
faithfully under the yoke of Christ until death.</p>
<br />

<h4>XLIX. THE DEATH OF CIARAN</h4>
<p>
<b>22.</b> The most glorious soldier of Christ, shining with
these and many other [miracles], like the luminary which
presides over the day, as he reached the setting of his
natural course, approached it, seized with grievous sickness.
But because he who shall have endured unto the
end shall be saved, so the champion of Christ, not only
strengthening himself in the battle of this conflict, but
also calling on souls to conquer, caused the stone, on
which, supporting his head, he was wont until then to
concede a little sleep to his body, to be placed even
under his shoulders; then raising his holy hand he blessed
the brethren, and, fortified by reception of the viaticum
of salvation, gave back his soul to heaven. For as that
blessed soul departed from the body, the choirs of angels
with hymns and songs received it into the glory of God.</p>
<br />

<h4>LI. THE EARTH OF CIARAN'S TOMB DELIVERS COLUM<br />
CILLE FROM A WHIRLPOOL</h4>
<p>
<b>23.</b> Also, when the most blessed abbot of Christ,
Columba, heard of the death of Saint Keranus, he
composed a notable hymn about him: and he brought
it down with him to the monastery of Cluayn, where, as
was fitting, he was received with hospitality in honour.
Now as for the hymn, the abbot who was then presiding,<span class="page"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[page 57]</span>
and the others who had heard it, lauded it with many
lofty praises. But when Saint Columba was departing
thence, he took away with him earth from the sacred
grave of Saint Keranus, knowing in the spirit how useful
this would be against future perils of the sea. For in
the part of the sea which bears towards the monastery
of Í, there is a very great danger to those who cross,
partly because of the vehemence of the currents, and
partly because of the narrowness of the sea; so that
ships are whirled round and driven in a circle, and thus
are often sunk. For it is rightly compared to Scylla and
Charybdis; I mean that by its grave and unmitigated
dangerousness, evil is there the lot of sailors. When they
were coming to this strait, they suddenly began to glide
into it in their course: and when they looked for nothing
but death, and because they were as though apt to be
devoured by the horrible jaws of the abyss, then Saint
Columba taking some of the aforesaid dust that had been
taken from the tomb of blessed Keranus, cast it into
that sea. Then there befell a thing marvellous and
worthy of great wonder; for sooner than it is told, that
cruel storm ceased, and accorded them a quiet passage.
Truly do the just live for ever; among whom blessed
Queranus reigneth, the earth or dust of whose sepulchre
stilled the sea, established in the Faith the hearts of
those who feared, and strengthened them to good works.
Wherefore blessed Keranus liveth not only for God, to
whom he is inseparably bound, but also for men, on
whom in time of need he bestoweth benefits.</p>
<br />

<h4>A RIME ABOUT HIM</h4>
<p>
<b>1.</b> As the mother of Quiaranus sat in a noisy carriage,
a wizard heard the sound and said out to his attendant
lads, "See ye who is in the carriage, for it soundeth<span class="page"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[page 58]</span>
under a king." "The wife," say they, "of Beodus the
wright sitteth here." The wizard says: "She shall bear
a king acceptable to all, whose works shall shine like
Phoebus in the sky." The soldier of Christ, Keranus, a
temple of the Holy Spirit, flourished in the virtue of
spiritual piety.</p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> He bestowed the sucking calf of a cow on a hound;
then his mother severely upbraided Queranus. He asked
the devoured calf from the hound itself, and presently
bearing back its bones he restored it.</p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> The bald head of a royal woman had been made
bare by the envy of an evil concubine; when it was
signed in the name of Queranus it shone adorned with
golden hair.</p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> When Queranus was occupied with sacred studies,
and asked time that he might engage himself therein,
then the mill is moved for him by angels.</p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> The gospel text had fallen into a lake, but when
time passed, by the merits of Queranus, a cow brought
it back sound from the abyss.</p>
<p>
<b>6.</b> When as a boy he was praying the Lord, and was
spending his time in prayer, fire came from above in
the citadel of the pole. The dead boy descried the
lights of life, and the saints glorify the mighty Lord.
Sparkling fire falling from heaven is kindled and forthwith
he completes his especial duty.</p>
<p>
<b>7.</b> To the high and ineffable company of apostles of
the heavenly Jerusalem, the lofty watch-tower, sitting
on thrones shining like the sun, Queranus the holy priest,
the eminent messenger of Christ, is exalted by the
heavenly hands of angels, with the happy clans of holy
ones made perfect; whom Thou, Christ, hast sent as a
man, an apostle to the world, glorious in all the latest
times.</p>

<h2>THE THIRD LATIN LIFE OF SAINT CIARAN</h2>

<h4>II. THE ORIGIN AND BIRTH OF CIARAN: THE WIZARD'S PROPHECIES</h4>
<p>
<b>1.</b> The blessed and venerable abbot Queranus was
born of a noble and religious stock of the Scots, of a
father Beoid, that is Boeus, by name, who was a cartwright,
and of a mother Darerca; of these many saints
were born. This man of God was prophesied of by
Saint Patrick, fifty years before his birth. Moreover
when his mother, sitting in a carriage one day, passed
near the house of a certain wizard, the wizard, hearing
the noise of the carriage said in prophecy, "The carriage
soundeth under a king." And when his folk went in
surprise to see the truth of the matter, and beheld no
one but the wife of Boeus in the carriage, they said in
mockery, "Lo, the wife of Beoit sitteth in the carriage."
To whom the wizard said, "Not of her do I speak, but of
the son whom she hath in her womb, who shall be a
mighty king; and as the sun blazeth in mid-day, so shall
he with miracles shine and illumine this island." After
this, as his father was being burdened under the taxes
of Anmereus, that is Anmirech, leaving his native region
he departed into the territory of the Conactei; and
there in the plain of Ay he begat his blessed son Queranus,
who was baptized and instructed by a certain holy man,
Dermicius by name. And the holy boy, in manners
beyond his years, worked many wonders.</p><br />

<span class="page"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[page 60]</span>

<h4>III. HOW CIARAN RAISED THE STEED OF OENGUS FROM DEATH</h4>
<p>
<b>2.</b> So when the horse of the son of the king of that
territory died by accident, he saw in a vision a shining
man saying to him, "The holy boy Quieranus who liveth
among you, can quicken thy horse. Present him with
a reward for the health of thy horse, and he shall resuscitate
him." The royal youth, awakened from sleep,
went to Queranus, and prayed him on behalf of the
horse. The holy boy, without delay, blessed water, and
when he poured it into the mouth of the horse it was
restored to its former health. And when the king saw
what was done, he made over an excellent field as a
reward to Saint Quieranus.</p>
<br />

<h4>IV. HOW CIARAN TURNED WATER INTO HONEY</h4>
<p>
<b>3.</b> At another time his mother upbraided him because,
though the other boys collected honey for their mothers,
he used to bring her no honey. But hearkening humbly
to his mother, he went to a neighbouring spring, and
carrying thence a vessel full of water, he blessed it, and
it was changed into excellent honey.</p>
<br />

<h4>V. HOW CIARAN WAS DELIVERED FROM A HOUND</h4>
<p>
<b>4.</b> On a certain other day some men, spurred by a
malignant spirit, incited a most savage dog to devour
the holy man. But Keranus trusting in the Lord, and
fortifying himself with the buckler of prayer, said,
"Deliver not the soul that trusteth in Thee unto
beasts"; and soon the dog died.</p><br />

<span class="page"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[page 61]</span>

<h4>IX. HOW CIARAN RESTORED A CALF WHICH A WOLF HAD DEVOURED</h4>
<p>
<b>5.</b> When at another time he was feeding the herds of
his parents, as men are wont to <a name="three1r" id="three1r"></a>do,<a href="#three1"><sup>1</sup></a> a cow brought forth
a calf in his presence. But there came a hound consumed
with leanness, seeking to fill his belly with what
fell from the body of the mother along with the
calf; and moved with compassion he said unto him,
"Eat, poor wretch, yonder calf, for great is thy need
of it." The hound fulfilled the commands of Keranus,
and ate the calf to the bones. As Keranus returned
home to the house of his parents with the herds,
the cow, recalling the calf to memory, went running
about lowing. The mother of Keranus, recognising the
cause of its lowing, said with indignation to the boy,
"Restore the calf, Keranus, even though it be burnt
with fire or drowned in the sea." But he, obeying his
mother, returned to the place where the calf had been
devoured, collected the bones, and carried them with
him and placed them before the mother <span class="note">[<i>father</i>, MS.]</span>,
asking his God with diligence to hear his prayers for the
resuscitation of the calf. And God hearkened to the
holy one, and resuscitated the calf in the presence of
his parents.</p>
<br />

<h4>X. HOW CIARAN WAS DELIVERED FROM ROBBERS</h4>
<p>
<b>6.</b> At another time there came robbers to him when
he was feeding the herds of his parents, wishing to slay
him, so that they might the more easily reave what
they would. But God had regard to their attempt from
on high, and so multiplied infirmities upon them that
they turned in haste to God. For they were smitten
with blindness, nor could they move hand or foot, till<span class="page"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[page 62]</span>
they wrought repentance, and were loosed by the merit
of Saint Keranus: recovering the light of their eyes and
the vigour of their other members.</p>
<br />

<h4>XIV. HOW CIARAN GAVE THE KING'S CAULDRON TO BEGGARS AND WAS ENSLAVED</h4>
<p>
<b>7.</b> It happened after this that he gave a cauldron
belonging to the king, as he had nothing else to give to
poor folk asking of him an alms. When the king heard
what had been done, he was greatly enraged, and commanded
his people to bring Saint Keranus to him in
bonds. When he was led to the king, he gave sentence
that he should be reduced to servitude, and be set apart
for grinding at the quern. But God, having regard to the
humiliation of His servant, caused the mill to be moved
of itself without human hand, and left Ciaran free to
chant his Psalms. After a few days coppersmiths from
the land of the Mumunienses brought three cooking-pots
with them, and offered them to Saint Keranus. Giving
thanks for these to God, he was delivered from the yoke
of servitude.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXIII. THE BLESSING OF CIARAN'S FOOD</h4>
<p>
<b>8.</b> When on a certain day he was journeying alone,
and the time of partaking of food had come, seeking
one to bless for him he said "<i>Benedic.</i>" And as no one
answered, he departed, fasting. On the following day,
seeking one to bless and finding him not, he went on
fasting in like manner. On the third day he went forth
fasting, and being weary with the journey he lay down;
and when he asked a benediction as was customary, a
voice came from heaven and blessed his meal, and so,
eating and giving thanks, he completed his journey.</p><br />

<span class="page"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[page 63]</span>

<h4>XV. HOW CIARAN REPROVED HIS MOTHER</h4>
<p>
<b>9.</b> One time when he was coming from the fields to
the house certain strangers met him; and when he had
asked them whence they had come, they said, "From
the house of Boetius the wright." And when he had
again asked them how they had been refreshed there,
they answered, "Not only got we no food, but the woman
of the house heaped insults and abuse upon us." But
he, fired with the flames of charity, went to his father's
house, and cast whatsoever of food he found there into
the mud, thinking that what was not offered to Christ,
and that in which the pleasure of the devil was wrought,
was corrupt and unclean and should not be eaten of any.</p>
<br />

<h4>XVI. THE BREAKING OF THE CARRIAGE-AXLE</h4>
<p>
<b>10.</b> At another time when with his father he was
sitting in a carriage, the axle of the carriage broke in
two; but yet for the whole day they continued their
journey safely, without any mishap.</p>
<br />

<h4>XVII. HOW CIARAN WENT WITH HIS COW TO THE SCHOOL OF FINDIAN</h4>
<p>
<b>11.</b> After these things, having heard the renown of
the holiness and sound doctrine of Saint Finnianus of
Cluayn Hyrart, he desired to hasten to him as to a living
fountain, and asked of his mother a cow, to yield him
the food necessary to sustain life. When his mother
refused his request, he went to the kine of his mother,
trusting in his God, and blessed one of them in the name
of God; and the cow, by the favour of God, mindful of
the blessing of the man of God, followed him with her
calf till he had arrived at the church of the man of God
Fynnianus. When the man of God arrived at the place<span class="page"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[page 64]</span>
of his desire, he drew a dividing-line with his rod between
the cow and the calf, in the name of Him who set a
boundary to the waters that they should not transgress
their limit, and this they did not cross till they were
permitted. The milk of that cow was sufficient for
twelve men every day.</p>
<br />

<h4>XVIII. THE ANGELS GRIND FOR CIARAN</h4>
<p>
<b>12.</b> At that time there were twelve very holy and
reverend men reading in that school, and each of them
on his day ground at the quern with his own hand, as
was customary. But in the day of Saint Keranus the
angels of God used to turn the quern for him.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ROBBERS OF LOCH ERNE</h4>
<p>
<b>13.</b> At another time, when blessed Keranus had been
in an island situated in Loch Eirne, in the school of a
holy man; and it was a custom with the saints that three
men should go out with an elder to bring in timber;
it was the lot of Saint Keranus to go to the forest with
three monks to cut timber. And when he was praying
apart and the others were cutting wood, robbers came
and slew those three monks, and cut off and carried away
their heads with them. Saint Keranus, not hearing the
sound of those who were hacking and hewing timber,
returned from the place of prayer and found his three
companions slain and decapitated. But the man of
God, though first he grieved sorely over this deed, yet,
recovering his power from Him Who deserteth not His
own in their necessity, hastened after the murderers,
and found them sweating to drag a little boat down to
the water. But it was wondrously contrived that the <span class="page"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[page 65]</span>
skiff should weigh most heavily, like a ship, and with
this their bodily strength wholly failed them. Then
they turned themselves to the holy man, and begging
pardon of him, they obtained it in mercy. And when
as a price for their restored strength he obtained the
heads of his companions from the robbers, he ran with
them to the place where the bodies of the martyrs were
lying, placed each of them respectively at the junction
with its body, and restored them to life from death in
the Name of the Holy Trinity. And as a sign of this
unwonted miracle, so long as they lived there remained
a blood-marked circle round their necks, that thereby
the Faithful should be strengthened in the Faith and the
infidels confuted. It endeth; Amen.</p>

<h2>THE IRISH LIFE OF SAINT CIARAN</h2>

<h4>I. THE HOMILETIC INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>
<b>1.</b> <i>Omnia quaecumque uultis ut faciant homines uobis,
ita et uos faciatis illis, haec est enim lex et prophetae:</i><br />
"Every good thing that ye wish to be done unto you
by men, let it be likewise that ye do to them, for that
is Law and Prophecy."</p>
<p>
Now He Who prohibiteth every evil, Who proclaimeth
every good, Who reconcileth God and man, Jesus Christ
Son of the Living God, the Saviour of the whole world,
He it is Who spake these words; to teach His apostles
and His disciples and the whole Church concerning the
<a name="il1r" id="il1r"></a>covenant<a href="#il1"><sup>1</sup></a> of charity; that men should do of good and
of charity to their neighbour as much as they would do
unto themselves. To that end saith Jesus, <i>Omnia
quaecumque uultis</i>. Now Matthew son of Alphaeus, the
eminent sage of the Hebrews, one of the four who
expounded the Gospel of the Lord, he it is who wrote
these words in the heart of his Gospel, saying after his
Master Jesus, <i>Omnia quaecumque</i>.</p>
<p>
<i>Si ergo uos, cum sitis mali, nostis bona data dare filiis
uestris, quanto magis Pater uester celestis dabit bona
petentibus <a name="il2r" id="il2r"></a>Se:</i><a href="#il2"><sup>2</sup></a> That is, "If ye being men [<i>sic</i>] give
good gifts to your children, much more shall the
Heavenly Father give good to His children who ask
Him." It is after these words that Jesus spake this
counsel, <i>Omnia quaecumque,</i> etc. For Law and Prophecy
command us to give love to God and to the neighbour.<span class="page"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[page 67]</span>
<i>Finis enim precepti caritas est, quia caritas propria et
specialis uirtus est Christianorum. Nam caeterae uirtutes
bonis et malis possunt esse communes; caritatem autem
habere nisi perfecti non possunt. Vnde Iesus ait, "In hoc
cognoscent omnes quod discipuli Mei estis, si dilexeritis
inuicem."</i> "For the roof and summit of divine doctrine
is charity, because charity is the especial virtue of the
Christians. For the other virtues may belong to good
and to evil men alike; but none hath charity save good
men only. Wherefore Jesus saith, 'Hereby shall all
men recognise that ye are of My folk, if each of you
loveth his fellow as I have loved <a name="il3r" id="il3r"></a>you.'" <a href="#il3"><sup>3</sup></a> <i>Et iterum dixit
Iesus: Hoc est preceptum meum ut diligatis inuicem sicut
dilexi uos.</i> "And thus said Jesus further: 'This is
my counsel to you, that each of you love his fellow as I
have loved you.'"</p>
<p>
Many of the children of life, apostles and disciples of
the Lord, have thenceforward fulfilled with zeal and
with piety the counsel that Jesus gave them as to fulfilling
charity; as <i>he</i> fulfilled and loved charity especially
beyond all virtues, to wit the noble glorious apostle,
the father confessor, the spark-flashing, the man through
whom the west of the world shone with signs and
wonders, with virtues and with good deeds, <i>Sanctus
Ciaranus sacerdos et apostolus Dei</i>, the archpresbyter and
apostle Saint Ciaran, son of the wright. Now he was
son of the Wright Who formed heaven and earth with
all that in them is, according to his heavenly genealogy;
and son of the wright who used to frame carriages and
all other handiworks beside, according to his earthly
genealogy.</p>
<p>
The date which the Faithful honour as the feast-day<span class="page"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[page 68]</span>
of this noble one is the fifth of the ides of September
according to the day of the solar month, and this day
to-day according to the day of the week.</p>
<p>
Accordingly I shall relate a short memoir of the signs
and wonders of that devout one, for a delight of soul
to the Faithful; and of his earthly generation, and of his
mode of <a name="il4r" id="il4r"></a>life,<a href="#il4"><sup>4</sup></a> and of the perfection which he gave to his
victorious course in the earth. A man held greatly in
honour of the Lord was this man. A man for whom God
reserved his monastery, fifty years before his birth; a
man whom Christ accounteth in the order of apostles in
this world, as Colum Cille said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent1">
<i>Quem Tu Christe apostolum mundo misisti hominem.</i></p>

<p>
A lamp was he, shining with the light of wisdom and
doctrine, as Colum Cille said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent1">
<i>Lucerna huius insulae lucens luce mirabili.</i></p>

<p>
A man who established a cathedral from which was
drawn the effectiveness of rule, and wisdom, and doctrine,
for all the churches of Ireland, as the same man of learning
said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent1">
<i>Custodiantur regmina adcessione edita<br />
Diuulgata per omnia sanctorum <a name="il5r" id="il5r"></a>monasteria</i><a href="#il5"><sup>5</sup></a>&mdash;</p>

<p>
that is, "Let the rules and doctrines and customs which
have been received from the master, from Ciaran, be
kept by the elders of these monasteries; thus, these are
the rules and customs that have been distributed and
received of all the monasteries of saints of Ireland."
For it is from her [Clonmacnois] that are carried rules
and precepts throughout Ireland.</p>
<p>
He is a man whom the Lord accounteth of the order of<span class="page"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[page 69]</span>
chief prophets in this world, as the same prophet said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent1">
<i>Propheta qui nouissimus fuerit <a name="il6r" id="il6r"></a>praesagminibus,</i><a href="#il6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>
for it was by reason of his nobility and his reverence
before the Lord that he was foretold of prophets long
before his birth, as Isaac was foretold, and John the
Baptist, and Jesus, which is something yet <a name="il7r" id="il7r"></a>nobler.<a href="#il7"><sup>7</sup></a>
First Patrick son of Calpurn prophesied of him in
Cruachan Aigli, after the tree had closed around his
relics in the place where that settlement is now. Brigit
prophesied of him when she saw the fire and the angel,
fifty years before Ciaran, in the place where the Crosses
of Brigit are to-day. Becc mac De prophesied, saying
there&mdash;</p>

<p>
Beoit son of Olchan of the Latharna of Mag Molt of the<span class="page"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[page 70]</span>
Ulaid was earthly father of Ciaran. Darerca daughter
of Ercan son of Buachall was his mother, as Ciaran
said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent2bq">
Mother mine, a woman good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she Darerca hight;<br />
Father, of Molt's Latharna<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was Beoit the wright.</p>

<p>
Of the Ciarraige of Irluachra was his mother, that is,
more especially, of the Glasraige. Glas the Poet was
her grandfather. Now this was the cause of the coming
together of those twain. When Beoit went to visit his
brethren who were in the territory of Cenel Fiachrach,
and when he saw the maiden Darerca before him, he
asked for her of her [friends and <a name="il8r" id="il8r"></a>her]<a href="#il8"><sup>8</sup></a> parents, so that
she was given him to wife. Thereafter she bore five
sons to him, and this is the order in which they were
born: Lucoll her firstborn, Donnan the second, Ciaran
the third, Odran the fourth, Cronan the fifth&mdash;he was
a deacon, but the other four sons were archpresbyters.
Furthermore she bore three daughters to him; two of
them were virgins, to wit Lugbec and Rathbeo; Pata
was the third daughter, and she was a pious widow.
These are the graveyards wherein are the relics of those
saints; Lucholl and Odran in Isel Chiarain, Donnan
and Ciaran in Cluain maccu Nois, Cronan the deacon and
Beoit and the three daughters in <i>Tech meic in tSaeir</i>.</p>
<p>
Now there was an impious king in the land of Ui
Neill at that time, Ainmire son of Colgan his name. He
impressed the tribelands and the septs under a grievous
tax. So Beoit went, a-fleeing from that king, into the
land of the Connachta, to Cremthann son of Lugaid son
of Dallan King of Ireland, to Raith Cremthainn in Mag
Ai. The day on which Ciaran was conceived was the
sixth of the calends of June, and he was born on the <span class="page"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[page 71]</span>
sixth of the calends of March.</p>
<p>
The birth of Ciaran was prophesied by Lugbrann the
wizard of the aforesaid king. The wizard <i>dixit</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent2bq">
Oengus' steed he made alive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while he yet in cradle rested;<br />
God this marvel did contrive,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Ciaran, in swathing vested.</p>

<p>
One day when the wizard heard the sound of the
carriage [he spake thus: "See, lads," said he, "who is
in the <a name="il9r" id="il9r"></a>carriage]<a href="#il9"><sup>9</sup></a>&mdash;for here is the sound of a carriage that
bears a king." When the lads went out they saw no
one save Beoit and Darerca in the carriage. When the
lads mocked the wizard, thus spake he : "The child who
is in the womb of the woman," said he, "shall be a
great king: as the sun shineth among the stars of
heaven, so shall he shine, in signs and wonders that
cannot be related, upon the earth."</p>
<p>
Thereafter was Saint Ciaran born, in Mag Ai at Raith
Cremthainn. He was baptized by deacon Iustus, for
it was fitting that the true one should be baptized by a
True One.</p>
<br />

<h4>III. HOW CIARAN RAISED THE STEED OF OENGUS FROM DEATH</h4>
<p>
<b>3.</b> A certain day the horse of Oengus son of Cremthann
died, and he had great sadness because of the death of
his horse. Now when Oengus slumbered, an angel of
God appeared to him in a dream, and thus he spake
with him: "Ciaran son of the wright shall come, and
shall raise thy horse for thee." And this was fulfilled,
for Ciaran came at the word of the angel, and blessed
water, and it was put over the horse, and the horse arose
from death forthwith. Then Oengus gifted a great <span class="page"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[page 72]</span>
land to God and to Ciaran in return for the raising of
the horse; Tir&#1463;na Gabrai is the name of the land. </p>
<br />

<h4>IV. HOW CIARAN TURNED WATER INTO HONEY</h4>
<p>
<b>4.</b> A certain day his mother upbraided him. "The
little village lads," said she, "bring with them honey out
from the combs to their folks, but thou bringest it
never to us." When Ciaran heard that, he went to a
certain spring, and he fills his vessel from it, and blesses
it: so that it became choice honey, and he gives that
honey to his mother; so she was thankful. That is the
honey which was given to deacon Uis (= Iustus) as a
fee for baptizing him.</p>
<br />

<h4>V. HOW CIARAN WAS DELIVERED FROM A HOUND</h4>
<p>
<b>5.</b> A certain day evil men incited a savage hound
against Ciaran, to tear him. When Ciaran saw the hound,
he sang this verse: <i>Ne tradas bestiis animam confitentem
tibi</i>. And when he said this the hound fell
forthwith and did not rise again.</p>
<br />

<h4>VI. HOW CIARAN AND HIS INSTRUCTOR CONVERSED<br />
THOUGH DISTANT FROM ONE ANOTHER</h4>
<p>
<b>6.</b> This was the labour that his parents used to lay upon
him, namely, herding, after the likeness of David son of
Jesse, and of Jacob, and of the elders thenceforth, for God
knew that he would be a wise shepherd of great flocks,
that is, the flocks of the Faithful. Thereafter a marvellous
thing took place at Raith Cremthainn in Mag Ai: he
was keeping the flocks of [his parents at Raith Cremthainn,
and there was <a name="il10r" id="il10r"></a>dwelling]<a href="#il10"><sup>10</sup></a> his tutor, deacon Uis, at<span class="page"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[page 73]</span>
Fidharta, and there was a long space between them:
yet he used to hear what his tutor was saying as though
they were side by side.</p>
<br />

<h4>VII. CIARAN AND THE FOX</h4>
<p>
<b>7.</b> Then there came a fox to Ciaran from out the
wood, and behaved tamely with him. It would often
visit him, so that he bade it do him a service, namely,
to carry his book of Psalms between him and his teacher,
deacon Uis. For when he would say in Fidharta, "Say
this in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Spirit," Ciaran would hear in Raith Cremthainn,
from that on to the end of the lesson; and the fox would
be awaiting the lesson obediently till its writing on wax
was completed, and ther id="il11r"eafter he would carry it with
him to <a name="il11r" id="il11r"></a>Ciaran.<a href="#il11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>
Once on a time his natural treacherousness broke forth
in the fox, and he began to eat the book: for he was
greedy for the leather that was bound around the book
outside. While he was eating the book, there came
Oengus son of Cremthann with kernes and with hounds,
so that they chased him, and he found no sanctuary
till he came under the cloak of Ciaran. The name of
God and Ciaran's were magnified by the rescue of the
book from the fox and by the rescue of the fox from
the hounds. The book is what is now called the
"Tablet of Ciaran."</p>
<p>
Most consonant with these things is it for evil men who
are near to the Church, and who profit by the advantages
of the Church&mdash;communion, and baptism, and food, and
teaching&mdash;and withal stay not from persecuting the<span class="page"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[page 74]</span>
Church, until there come upon themselves the persecution
of some king, or mortality, or a disease unknown:
and then they needs must flee under the protection of
the Church, as the fox went under the cloak of <a name="il12r" id="il12r"></a>Ciaran!<a href="#il12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<br />

<h4>VIII. HOW CIARAN SPOILED HIS MOTHER'S DYE</h4>
<p>
<b>8.</b> A certain day the mother of Ciaran was making
blue dye, and she had reached the point of putting
the garments therein. Then said his mother to him,
"Get thee out, Ciaran." For they thought it unbecoming
that males should be in the house when garments
were being dyed. "May there be a dun stripe upon
them!" said Ciaran. Of all the garments that were
put into the dye, there was not one that had not a dun
stripe upon it. The dye is prepared again, and his
mother said, "Go out, Ciaran, this time, and now,
Ciaran, let there be no dun stripe." Then he said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent2bq">
  Alleluia Domine!<br />
  White my mother's dye let be!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When in my hand it's gone,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be it white as bone!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When boiling it is stirred,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be it white as curd!</p>

<p>
Accordingly every garment that was placed therein was
of a uniform whiteness. For the third time is the dye
made. "Ciaran," said his mother, "hurt me not the
dye now, but let it receive a blessing from thee." When
Ciaran blessed the dye, never was dye made so good,
before or since; for though all the garments of Cenel
Fiachrach (<i>sic</i>) were placed in its <i>iarcain</i>, it would turn
them blue; and at the last it turned blue the dogs and
the cats and the trees that came in contact with it.
</p>
<span class="page"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[page 75]</span>
<h4>IX. HOW CIARAN RESTORED A CALF WHICH A WOLF HAD DEVOURED</h4>
<p>
<b>9.</b> Once he was tending kine. A miserable wolf came
to him. Now this was a habitual expression with him,
"Mercy on us." [He said to the wolf in <a name="il13r" id="il13r"></a>compassion]<a href="#il13"><sup>13</sup></a>
"Rise and devour the calf and break or eat not its bones."
The wolf went and did so. When the cow lowed a-seeking
the calf, his mother spake thus to him: "Tell me,
Ciaran, where is the calf of this cow? Let the calf be
restored by thee, whatsoever death it has died." Ciaran
went to the place where the wolf had devoured the calf,
and collected the bones of the calf, and brought them
before the cow, and the calf arose and stood up. <i>Ut
dixit</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent2bq">
  One day when, assiduously<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ciaran the kine was havening,<br />
  He a calf for charity<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave to a wolf <a name="il14r" id="il14r"></a>ravening.<a href="#il14"><sup>14</sup></a></p><br />

<h4>X. HOW CIARAN WAS DELIVERED FROM ROBBERS</h4>
<p>
<b>10.</b> A certain day there came robbers from Ui Failge
to slay people [in the <a name="il15r" id="il15r"></a>land]<a href="#il15"><sup>15</sup></a> of Cenel Fiachach, and they
found Saint Ciaran a-reading with his herds; and they
went forward to slay him. But they were smitten with
blindness, and could stir neither foot nor hand, till they
wrought repentance, and were loosed by the word of
God and of Ciaran.</p>
<br />

<h4>XIV. HOW CIARAN GAVE THE KING'S CAULDRON TO<br />
BEGGARS AND WAS ENSLAVED</h4>
<p>
<b>11.</b> Another time his father sent him to present a
cauldron to the king, even to Furban. There met him
poor men on the way, and [<a name="il16r" id="il16r"></a>Ciaran]<a href="#il16"><sup>16</sup></a> gifts the king's<span class="page"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[page 76]</span>
cauldron to them. So he was put in bonds then, and
slavery was imposed on him at the king's hands; and
this was the labour put upon him, to grind at the quern.
Then great marvels came to pass, for when he went to
grind at the quern, it would turn of itself, and did so
continually. They were the angels of the Lord who used
to grind for his sake. Not long thereafter there came
smiths from the lands of Muma, with three cauldrons for
Ciaran as an alms, and thus was Ciaran delivered from
servitude to the king.</p>
<br />

<h4>XVII. HOW CIARAN WENT WITH HIS COW TO THE SCHOOL OF FINDIAN</h4>
<p>
<b>12.</b> Now after those things Ciaran thought it time to
go a-schooling to Findian of Cluain Iraird, to learn
wisdom. He begged a cow of his mother and of his
father, to take it with him to serve <a name="il17r" id="il17r"></a>him.<a href="#il17"><sup>17</sup></a> His mother
said that she would not give it him. He blessed one of
the kine, to wit the Dun Cow of Ciaran, as she was called
thenceforward, and she went with her calf after Ciaran
thence to Cluain Iraird. Afterwards he drew a line with
his staff between them, for between them there was no
fence, and the cow used to lick the calf and neither of
them transgressed the mark. Now the milk of that cow
used to be divided between the twelve bishops with
their folk and their guests, and it was sufficient for
them; <i>ut dixit</i>,</p>

<p class="indent2bq">
  Ciaran's Dun was wont to feed,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three times fifty men in all;<br />
  Guests and sick folk in their need,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in soller and in dining-hall.</p>
<p>
The hide of the Dun is in Clonmacnois, and whatsoever<span class="page"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[page 77]</span>
soul parteth from its body from that hide [hath no
portion in hell, <a name="il18r" id="il18r"></a>and]<a href="#il18"><sup>18</sup></a> dwelleth in eternal life.</p>
<br />

<h4>XVIII. THE ANGELS GRIND FOR CIARAN</h4>
<p>
<b>13.</b> Now there were the twelve <a name="il19ar" id="il19ar"></a>bishops<a href="#il19a"><sup>19</sup></a> of Ireland in
the school of Findian in Cluain Iraird, <i>ut dixit</i>,</p>

<p class="indent2bq">
  Two Findians, holy Colums two,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ciaran, Cainnech, Comgall fair;<br />
  Two Brenainns, Ruadan bright of hue,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninned, Mo-Bi, Mac Natfraeich there.</p>

<p>
This was their rule, that every <a name="il19br" id="il19br"></a>bishop<a href="#il19b"><sup>19</sup></a> should grind at
the quern on his day. But angels used to grind at the
quern for Ciaran's sake on the day that was his.</p>
<br />

<h4>XIX. CIARAN AND THE KING'S DAUGHTER</h4>
<p>
<b>14.</b> The daughter of the King of Cualu was brought
once upon a time to Findian to read her Psalms, after
offering her virginity to God. Findian committed the
maiden to Ciaran, so that it was with him that she used
to read her Psalms. Now Ciaran saw naught of the body
of the maiden, so long as they were together, save her
feet only. As is verified in the stanza&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent2bq">
  A maid, rich in stateliness<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with Ciaran there was reading;<br />
  Of her form or shapeliness,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was all <a name="il20r" id="il20r">unheeding</a>.<a href="#il20"><sup>20</sup></a></p><br />

<span class="page"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[page 78]</span>

<h4>XX. HOW CIARAN HEALED THE LEPERS</h4>
<p>
<b>15.</b> There came then twelve lepers to Findian for their
healing. Findian sent them to Ciaran. Ciaran welcomed
them, and went with them westward from the
cell, and tears a sod from the ground, so that a stream
of pure water breaks forth from thence. He poured three
waves of the water over each of them, so that they were
healed forthwith.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXI. CIARAN AND THE STAG</h4>
<p>
<b>16.</b> Further, into that school there used to come a
stag to Ciaran, and he would place his book on the horns
of the stag. One day there Ciaran heard the bell. He
arose suddenly at the sound of the bell, but still swifter
was the arising of the stag, and it went off, with his
book on its horns. Though that day and the following
night were wet, and though the book was open, not a
letter in it was moistened. The cleric arose on the
morrow, and the stag came to him with his book
uninjured.</p>
<br />

<h4>XVII. THE STORY OF CIARAN'S GOSPEL</h4>
<p>
<b>17.</b> Now into that school there came Ninned the
Squinting, from the lochs of Erne, to read with Findian;
and he had no book. "Seek a book," said Findian.
Ninned went a-searching round the school, and did not
obtain a book from any of them. "Hast thou gone to
the gentle youth on the north side of the lawn?" said
Findian. "I shall go now," said Ninned. Now when
Ninned reached him, Ciaran was going over the central
text of the book of Matthew: <i>Omnia quaecumque uultis
ut faciant homines uobis, ita et uos faciatis illis</i>. "I have
come for the loan of a book," said Ninned. "Mercy on<span class="page"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[page 79]</span>
us," said Ciaran, "for that do I read this, and this is
what the text saith to me, that everything that I would
that men should do to me, I should do to all. Take
thou the book," said Ciaran. On the morrow his companions
asked of him, at the time of the lesson, where
his book was. "He gave it to me," said Ninned. "Let
'Ciaran Half-Matthew' be his name," said one of the
school. "Nay," said Findian, "but Ciaran Half-Ireland;
for his shall be half of Ireland, and ours the
other <a name="il21r" id="il21r"></a>half."<a href="#il21"><sup>21</sup></a> As Findian said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent2bq">
Holy Ciaran zealously<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under Findian studying pored;<br />
Half his book he left unread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;half of Ireland his reward.</p>

<p>
From this was the well-known saying <i>Non legam Marcum
quousque compleueram Mattheum</i> carried to Rome, to
Alexander.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXIV. THE STORY OF THE MILL AND THE BAILIFF'S DAUGHTER</h4>
<p>
<b>18.</b> Now it came to pass that there was scarcity of
corn and sustenance in that school, so that it was necessary
for a strong man of them in turn to protect the sack
of grain that was being carried to the mill.</p>
<p>
It happened that Ciaran, in his turn, was carrying a
sack of oats to the mill. As he was opening the sack,
he said, "O Lord," said he, "I would that this were
fine wheat, so that it were a great and a kindly and a
pleasant satisfaction to the elders." And so it came to
pass: the angel of God took the mill in his hands, and he
[Ciaran] was rendering his Psalms in purity of heart<span class="page"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[page 80]</span>
and mind, and the oats which were being put in were
choice wheat as they were coming out.</p>
<p>
Now the daughter of the bailiff of the mill came,
amorous for Ciaran; and she gave her love to him, for
fairer was he in form than any other of his time. "Most
hard for thee is <a name="il22r" id="il22r"></a>that,"<a href="#il22"><sup>22</sup></a> said Ciaran. "Is it not these
things to which thou shouldest give heed&mdash;the passing
of the world, and the Day of Judgment, and the pains
of Hell to shun them, and the rewards of Heaven to earn
them?" When the maiden went home, she tells that
tale to her father and her mother. They came and
offered the maiden to Ciaran. "If she sacrifice her
virginity to God," said Ciaran, "and if she serve Him,
I will be in union with her." Then the maiden offered
her virginity to God and to Ciaran, and her folk offered
their perpetual service and perpetual subjecthood to
Ciaran from that onward.</p>
<p>
When they went to their house, a portion was sent
to Ciaran by them, to wit, three wheaten cakes, with
their meed of suet and flesh, and a vessel full of ale.
When the servants left it, and received a blessing, he
said, "Mercy on us," said he, "it is not right for us
to eat of this, with exclusion of the other brethren."
Thereafter he cast all the food, after shredding it fine,
upon the mill, and he cast the ale likewise, so that all
was turned to fine flour.</p>
<p>
When Ciaran perceived the servant spying on him at
the roof-ridge, he spake a word against him, saying, "May
the crane," said he, "take thine eye out of thy <a name="il23r" id="il23r"></a>head!"<a href="#il23"><sup>23</sup></a>
And so it came to pass; for a pet crane plucked his
eye out of his head, so that it was on his cheek as he<span class="page"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[page 81]</span>
was going home. The bailiff came straightway with the
servant, and they did obeisance to Ciaran, and he offered
the mill with all its land to Ciaran for the healing of the
lad. Ciaran laid his palm on the eye and put it in its
place, and he made the sign of the cross upon it so
that it became sound.</p>
<p>
When he finished the grinding of the corn, four full
sacks of consecrated wheat were there, by the grace of
God and of Ciaran. When he reached his house with
the wheat he made cakes for the elders. Now these cakes
were the best ever given to them; for from the time
when the mystic manna was received yonder by the
sons of Israel, there was not received the like of that
food. For in this wise was it, with the taste of every
food of excellence, [both bread and flesh, and of every
excellent <a name="il24ar" id="il24ar"></a>drink]<a href="#il24a"><sup>24</sup></a> both wine and mead; so that it filled
and healed all of them. For every man in sickness who
was in the whole city, whosoever ate any of it was whole
forthwith.</p>
<p>
The elders did not observe the nocturn that night
until prime on the morrow.</p>
<p>
When Findian asked of Ciaran regarding the miracle
that had taken place, Ciaran related from beginning to
[<a name="il24br" id="il24br"></a>end]<a href="#il24b"><sup>24</sup></a> how the mill and the land with its implements, or
its men, had been offered to him as a gift; "and there
for thee, Findian, is all that land," said Ciaran. Then
did Findian give his blessing fervently to Ciaran; <i>ut dixit</i>
Findian&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent2bq">
Ciaran my little heart,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom for holiness I love,<br />
Princely lands shall be thy part,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;favour, dearest, from above.<br /><br />

Ciaran, famous all around!<span class="page"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[page 82]</span><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wealth and wisdom on thee pour!<br />
So may, in thy Church renowned,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge grow yet more and more.</p>

<p>
Now this blessing was given fervently to Ciaran through
his great love and spiritual <a name="il25r" id="il25r"></a>exaltation.<a href="#il25"><sup>25</sup></a> So that there
he left half of the charity, and the nobility, and the
wisdom, among the men of Ireland to Ciaran and his
monastery. Moreover Ciaran left wealth to him and to
his monastery, so that thence is the wealth of Findian.</p>
<p>
That corn sufficed for the congregation of Findian for
forty days with their nights; and a third part of it
was stored up for sick folk, for it would heal every
malady, and neither mouse nor worm dared to destroy
it. [It endured a long <a name="il26r" id="il26r"></a>time]<a href="#il26"><sup>26</sup></a> until it turned at last to
clay. And every disease for which it was given would
be healed.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXV. THE STORY OF CLUAIN</h4>
<p>
<b>19.</b> One day when Ciaran was collecting a band of
reapers, there met him a youth named Cluain. "Help
us at the reaping to-morrow," said Ciaran. "I will,"
said Cluain. But when Cluain went home he said to his
folk, "Should one come from Ciaran for me," said he,
"say that I am sick." When this was told to the lad
who went to summon Cluain, he reported it to Ciaran.
When Ciaran heard it he laughed, and he understood
that Cluain was practising deception, for he was a
prophet of God in truth. Now when the folk of Cluain
went to awake him, thus they found him, without life.
Sorely did his folk bewail him, and there came the
people of the neighbourhood to ask them the cause of
their weeping. "Cluain," said they, "went to his bed<span class="page"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[page 83]</span>
in health, and now he is dead; and Ciaran hath slain
him with his word, for that he went not to reap for him."
All those people go to Ciaran to intercede with him for
the raising again of the dead: "we shall all," said they,
"reap for thee, and we shall give our labour and our
service to thee and to God for ever, if thou raise the
dead for us." Then said Ciaran to his servant: "Rise,"
said he, "and take my staff with thee to the dead, and
make the sign of the cross with the staff on his breast,
and speak this quatrain&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent2bq">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cluain did say<br />
He would reap with me today;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living, by a dread disease,<br />
Dead within his house he lay."</p>

<p>
Then Cluain arose forthwith and went with speed to
Ciaran. "A blessing on thee, holy Ciaran," said he,
"good is what thou hast done for me; for I am grateful
to have come from the many pains of hell. Now know
we the profit of obedience, and the unprofit of disobedience,
and we know in what great honour the Lord
and the folk of Heaven hold thee." Then he did
obeisance to Ciaran, and gave him labour.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXVIII. ANECDOTES OF CLUAIN IRAIRD</h4>
<p>
<b>20.</b> (<b><i>a</i></b>) Certain of the clerks asked of Findian which
of them would lead the prayer when Findian should be
no longer here. "Yonder youth [Ciaran] is he," said
Findian. "Thou givest the abbacy to him above us
all," said Brenainn. "It hath been given, it is given,
it shall be given," said Findian. All the saints except
Colum Cille were envious because of this.</p>
<p>
(<b><i>b</i></b>) Then certain of them asked which of the saints
should have the greatest reward in heaven. "Mercy on
us," said Ciaran, "that will be made known in our<span class="page"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[page 84]</span>
habitations on earth." Then Brenainn of Birra made a
prophecy of him: "We shall take two habitations,"
said Brenainn, "on two streams between chief cities,
and the difference that shall be between the two streams
shall be the difference between the size of the cities."</p>
<p>
(<b><i>c</i></b>) When it was time for Ciaran to depart from
Cluain Iraird, after learning letters and wisdom, he left
the Dun Cow with Saint Ninned; but he said that her
hide should come to him afterwards, and Ciaran said
further, "Though many be succoured by her milk, yet
there shall be more to whom her hide will give succour."
And he said, "Every soul that parteth from its body
from the hide of the Dun Cow shall not be pained in
hell."</p>
<p>
(<b><i>d</i></b>) Findian saw a vision of him [Ciaran] and of Colum
Cille, namely, two moons in the air with the colour of gold
upon them. One of them went north-east over the sea,
[and the <a name="il27r" id="il27r"></a>other]<a href="#il27"><sup>27</sup></a> over the middle of Ireland. That was
Colum Cille, with the glory of his nobility and his good
birth, and Ciaran with the glory of his charity and his
mercy.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXVI. HOW CIARAN FREED A WOMAN FROM SERVITUDE</h4>
<p>
<b>21.</b> Thereafter Ciaran went to parley with the King of
Ireland, Tuathal Moel-garb, to ask him for a slave-girl
that he had. Ciaran put his hand on the quern for
charity, and he promised that he would serve in the place
of the girl. Then Tuathal gifted the girl to God and to
Ciaran, and further he gave him his kingly apparel,
and Ciaran gave it forthwith to poor folk.</p><br />

<span class="page"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[page 85]</span>
<h4>XXVII. HOW CIARAN FREED ANOTHER WOMAN FROM SERVITUDE</h4>
<p>
<b>22.</b> One time Ciaran went to ask another slave-girl of
King Furbaide. Then one man gifted him a cow as an
alms, another gifted him a cloak, and another a kettle.
Forthwith on the same day he gave them all to poor folk;
and God gifted to Ciaran three gifts yet better, a cauldron
instead of the kettle, twelve robes instead of the one
robe, twelve kine instead of the one cow. When the
king saw that, he gave him the slave-girl.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXIX. THE PARTING OF FINDIAN AND CIARAN</h4>
<p>
<b>23.</b> When the time came for Ciaran to bid farewell
to his teacher, he offers to put his monastery at his
service. "Nay," said <a name="il28r" id="il28r"></a>Ciaran,<a href="#il28"><sup>28</sup></a> "sever not thy monastery
for any save for God alone, Who hath given thee
favour beyond us all." ["The monastery I give thee,"
said <a name="il29r" id="il29r"></a>Findian.]<a href="#il29"><sup>29</sup></a> Ciaran weeps, for he thought it noble
of his teacher to offer him his monastery. "Well,
then, let there be unity between us henceforth," said
Findian, "and let him who breaketh that unity have
no part in earth or in heaven." "Be it so," said Ciaran.
Then Ciaran went his way; and Colum Cille uttered
this testimony of him&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent2bq">
A wondrous youth from us departs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ciaran, craftsman's son;<br />
Of greed, of pride, reviling, lust,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;satire, he hath none.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXXII. CIARAN IN ARAN</h4>
<p>
<b>24.</b> Thereafter Ciaran went to Aran to hold converse
with Enda, and Enda and Ciaran saw one and the
same vision&mdash;a great fruitful tree beside a river in <span class="page"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[page 86]</span>
the middle of Ireland, a-sheltering the island of Ireland,
and its fruit was going over the sea that was around
the island outside, and the birds of the air were coming
and taking of the fruit. Ciaran went and told the
vision to Enda. Said Enda, "That great tree which
thou hast seen is thyself; for thou art great before
God and man, and Ireland shall be full of thine honour.
This island shall be protected under the shadow of thy
grace, and many shall be satisfied by the grace of thy
fasting and of thy prayer. Rise therefore at the word
of God, and go to the shore of the stream, and found a
church <a name="il30r" id="il30r"></a>there."<a href="#il30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<br />

<h4>XXXIII. HOW A PROPHECY WAS FULFILLED</h4>
<p>
<b>25.</b> Once when he was in Aran a-drying corn in the
kiln, and Lonan the Left-handed with him (one who
ever was contradictious of Ciaran) they saw a ship
foundering in their sight. "Methinks," said Lonan,
"yonder ship shall be drowned to-day and this kiln shall
be burned with the greatness of the draught." "Nay,"
said Ciaran, "yonder ship shall be burned, and this
kiln with its corn shall be <a name="il31r" id="il31r"></a>drowned."<a href="#il31"><sup>31</sup></a> And this was
fulfilled; for the crew of the ship escaped, and the
ship was cast on shore close to the kiln. The fire seized
the kiln, and the ship is burned. A blast of wind
struck the kiln and its corn into the sea, so that it
was drowned, according to the word of Ciaran.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXXIV. HOW CIARAN VISITED SENAN</h4>
<p>
<b>26.</b> When Ciaran left Aran a poor man met him on
the way. Ciaran gives him his linen cloak, and goes to
Inis Cathaig to salute Senan. That he was in one mantle<span class="page"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[page 87]</span>
only was revealed to Senan, and he went to meet him,
with a linen cloak under his armpit. And he said to
Ciaran, "Is it not shame," said he, "for a priest to
travel without a cowl?" "Mercy on us," said Ciaran,
"God will have pity [on my <a name="il32r" id="il32r"></a>nakedness];<a href="#il32"><sup>32</sup></a> there is a
cloak for me under the covering of mine elder."</p>
<br />

<h4>XLIII. HOW CIARAN SENT A CLOAK TO SENAN</h4>
<p>
<b>27.</b> When Ciaran arrived at Cluain maccu Nois he
wished to send another cloak to Senan. The cloak was
laid upon the stream of the Shannon, and it travelled
without being wetted to the harbour of Inis Cathaig.
Said Senan to his monks, "Rise and go to the sea,
and ye shall find there a guest, which bring with you,
with honour and dignity." When the monks went out
they found the cloak on the sea, dry, and they brought
it with them to Senan, and offered an offering of thanks
to the Lord. That is now called "Senan's cloak."</p>
<br />

<h4>XXXV. CIARAN IN ISEL</h4>
<p>
<b>28.</b>  Thereafter he went to his brethren to Isel, and
Cobthach son of Brecan gave Isel to God and to Ciaran;
and he lived there with his brethren. One day when
he was doing his lesson outside in the field, he went to
attend upon his guests, and left his book open till morning
under the rain; and not a damp drop fell upon the book.</p>
<p>
Once Ciaran was sowing seed in Isel. A poor man
came to him. Ciaran gives him a handful of the grain
into his breast, and the grain was forthwith turned into
gold. A chariot with its horses was gifted to Ciaran
by Oengus son of Cremthann. Ciaran gave it to the
poor man in exchange for the gold, and the gold turned
into grain, and the field was sown with it.</p><br />

<span class="page"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[page 88]</span>
<h4>XXXVI. THE REMOVAL OF THE LAKE</h4>
<p>
<b>29.</b> Moreover there was a lake near Isel, and country-folk
and despicable people used to occupy the island
that was upon it. The noise and uproar of those worthless
people used to cause disturbance for the clerics.
Ciaran prayed to the Lord that the island should be
removed from its place, and that was done. The place
where it was in the lake is still to be seen as a memorial
of that miracle.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXXVII. CIARAN DEPARTS FROM ISEL</h4>
<p>
<b>30.</b> As the brethren could not suffer the almsgiving
of Ciaran, so great was it, and as they were envious of
him, they said unto him, "Rise and depart from us,"
said they, "for we cannot be in the same place." Said
Ciaran, "Had I been here," said he, "though this spot
be lowly (<i>Ísel</i>) in situation, it would have been high
in glory and in honour." Then he said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent2bq">
Although lowly, it were high,<br />
Had not censure come me nigh;<br />
Had I not been censured so,<br />
It were high though it be low.</p>

<p>
Then Ciaran put his books upon a wild stag; afterwards
he accompanied the wild stag wheresoever it would go.
The deer went forward to Inis Aingin. He went into
the island and dwelt there.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXXVIII. CIARAN IN INIS AINGIN</h4>
<p>
<b>31.</b> Then his brethren came to him from every side.
There was a certain archpresbyter in the island, Daniel
his name. Of the British was he, and the devil incited
him to be jealous of Ciaran. A royal cup with three<span class="page"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[page 89]</span>
birds of gold was given him by Ciaran as a token of
forgiveness. The presbyter marvelled thereat, and repented,
and did obeisance to Ciaran, and gave the
island to him.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXXIX. THE COMING OF OENNA</h4>
<p>
<b>32.</b> Once Ciaran was in Inis Aingin and he heard a cry
in the port. He said to the brethren, "Rise and go for
your future abbot." When they reached the harbour
they found no man save a weak unconsecrated youth.
They tell that to Ciaran. "For all that, go again for
him; it is clear to me from his voice that it is he who
shall be abbot after me." Thereafter the youth was
brought into the island to Ciaran, and Ciaran tonsured
him, and he read with him. That was Enna maccu
Laigsi, a holy man, held in honour of the Lord; and it
is he who was abbot after Ciaran.</p>
<br />

<h4>XL. HOW CIARAN RECOVERED HIS GOSPEL</h4>
<p>
<b>33.</b> It happened that the gospel of Ciaran fell into the
lake from the hand of a heedless brother, and it was a
long time in the lake. Upon a day in the time of summer
the kine went into the water, so that the strap of the
gospel attached itself to the hoof of one of the kine,
and she brought it dry [from <a name="il33r" id="il33r"></a>below]<a href="#il33"><sup>33</sup></a> to haven. Thence
is "Port of the Gospel" in Inis Aingin. When the
gospel was opened it was in this wise&mdash;white and clean,
dry, without the loss of a letter, through the grace of
Ciaran.</p><br />

<span class="page"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[page 90]</span>
<h4>XLI. HOW CIARAN WENT FROM INIS AINGIN TO CLONMACNOIS</h4>
<p>
<b>34.</b> A certain man of Corco Baiscind came to Ciaran,
Donnan his name, brother's son of Senan mac Gerginn;
and he had the same mother as Senan. "What wouldest
thou, or wherefore comest thou?" said Ciaran. "Seeking
a place wherein to abide and to serve God." Ciaran
left Inis Aingin to Donnan. Donnan said, "Since
thou hast a charity towards me, leave me somewhat of
thy tokens and of thy treasures." Ciaran leaves him
his gospel&mdash;that which was recovered from the lake&mdash;and
his bell, and his bearer Mael Odran. Three years
and three months was Ciaran in Inis Aingin.</p>
<p>
He came thereafter to Ard Manntain, close to the
Shannon. When he saw the beauty of that place,
thus he spake: "If we dwell here," said he, "we shall
have much of the wealth of the world, and there shall
be few souls going to heaven from hence."</p>
<p>
Then he came to this town; Ard Tiprat was its
name at that time. "Here will we stay, for there
shall be many souls going to heaven from hence, and
God and man shall visit this place for ever."</p>
<p>
On the eighth of the calends of February Ciaran
settled in Cluain, the tenth day of the moon, a Saturday.
Eight men went with him&mdash;Ciaran, Oengus, Mac Nisse,
Cael-Cholum, Mo-<a name="il34r" id="il34r"></a>Beoc,<a href="#il34"><sup>34</sup></a> Mo-Lioc, Lugna maccu Moga
Laim, Colman mac Nuin. Wondrous was that monastery,
set up by Ciaran in Cluain with his eight men
after coming from the waves of the water, as Noah son
of Lamech took the world with his eight after coming
from the waves of the Flood.</p><br />

<span class="page"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[page 91]</span>
<h4>XLII. THE FOUNDATION OF THE CHURCH</h4>
<p>
<b>35.</b> Then Ciaran set up the first post in Cluain, and
Diarmait mac Cerrbheil along with him. Said Ciaran
to Diarmait when they were planting the post, "Warrior,
suffer my hand to be over thy hand, and thou shalt be
over the men of Ireland in high-kingship." "I permit
it," said Diarmait, "only give me a token thereof."
"I will," said Ciaran; "though thou art solitary to-day,
thou shalt be King of Ireland this time to-morrow."
That was verified; for Tuathal Moel-garb King of Ireland
was slain that night, and Diarmait took the kingship
of Ireland on the morrow, and he bestowed a
hundred churches on Ciaran. Wherefore to prove that, it
was said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent2bq">
I'll speak both choice and truly,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;although thou now art lonely,<br />
Thou shalt rule Ireland duly,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after one's day's space only.<br /><br />

The chosen Tuathal's slaughter,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a crying without glory.<br />
Thence is it said thereafter,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That deed was of Mael-Moire."<br /><br />

Without a court or slaughter,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great Diarmait Uisnech lifted;<br />
A hundred fanes thereafter,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to God and Ciaran gifted.</p>

<p>
Then was the post made fast; and Ciaran said in fixing
it, "Be this," said he, "in the eye of Tren." Tren
was a youth who was in the fortress of Cluain Ichtar,
and who had adventured arrogance against him. Forthwith
his one eye burst in his head, at the word of Ciaran.</p>
<br />

<h4>XLIV. CIARAN AND THE WINE</h4>
<p>
<b>36.</b> One day the brethren were sore athirst, while
they were reaping in Cluain. They send a messenger
to the cleric, that water be brought to them in the
field. Then Ciaran said, "If to-day they would<span class="page"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[page 92]</span>
endure thirst, it would procure great riches of the
world for the brethren who would come after them."
"Truly," said the brethren, "we prefer to exercise
patience, whereby profit will be secured for ourselves,
and advantage to the brethren who follow us; rather
than to have satisfaction of our thirst to-day."</p>
<p>
A cask full of wine was brought from the land of the
Franks to the steading, to Ciaran, in reward for their
patience; and a fragment of that cask remained here
till recently.</p>
<p>
When the evening was come, Ciaran blessed a vessel
full of water, and it was changed to choice wine, and
was divided among the monks; so that there was no
feast that excelled that feast. For the folk of Colum
Cille came from Í, after a long time, to this city. A
feast was prepared for them, and it was noised abroad
through the whole city that never before or since was
there a feast its equal. Then an aged man who was
in the house of the elders said, "I know," said he, "a
feast that was better than this feast. Better was the
feast that Ciaran made for his monks when they were
sore <a name="il35r" id="il35r"></a>athirst,<a href="#il35"><sup>35</sup></a> so that he changed water into wine for
them. That it be no story without proof for you,"
said the elder, "it was myself who divided that wine,
and my thumb would go over the edge of the cup
into the wine. Come and perceive now the savour of
my thumb, which then was dipped into the wine." They
came and were all satisfied with the savour of that
finger. And they said, "Better," said they, "than any
feast was that feast of which the savour remains after
a long time on a finger. A blessing," said they, "on
Ciaran and a blessing on the Lord Who allotted every
good thing to him."</p><br />

<h4>XLV. THE STORY OF CRITHIR</h4>
<p>
<b>37.</b> Crichid [<i>sic</i>] of Cluain, a servant of Ciaran, went
to Saigir and stayed there a long time. The devil
tempted him to quench the sacred fire which the monks
had in the kitchen. Said Ciaran of Saigir, that he
would not eat food till there should come guests who
would bring him fire. Crichid then went from them a
short distance outside the city, and wolves slew him,
but did not injure his body. When Ciaran the wright's
son heard of the death of his attendant, he went to Ciaran
of Saigir to seek for him. When he arrived, Ciaran of
Saigir said, "First of all ye need water for your feet;
but we have no fire to heat water for you. Let you as
guests give us fire, for God hath decreed this for you."
Then Ciaran the wright's son raised his hands to heaven,
and made fervent prayer. When the prayer was
finished, there came fire from heaven, and rested on his
breast. He protected his breast from the fire, and
carried it with him to the monastery. He cast from him
the fire on to the floor, and it did not hurt so much as the
fur of the robe of white linen which he was wearing.</p>
<p>
Then he revived his servant who had died before
that, and he ate food with them. The two Ciarans
then made a covenant together. "The wealth of the
world," said Ciaran son of the wright, "be in great
Saigir." "Knowledge and dignity incorruptible be in
Cluain maccu Nois," said Ciaran of Saigir.</p>
<br />

<h4>XLIX. THE DEATH OF CIARAN</h4>
<p>
<b>38.</b> The soul of Ciaran was not more than seven
months in this town before he went to heaven, on the
ninth day of September. When Ciaran knew that the
day of his death was drawing nigh, he made a prophecy
with great sorrow. He said that great would be the<span class="page"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[page 94]</span>
persecution of his city from evil men towards the end of
the world. "What then shall we do in the time of that
crime?" said the monks; "is it by thy relics we shall
stay, or shall we go elsewhere?" "Rise," said Ciaran,
"and leave my relics as the bones of a deer are left in
the sun. For it is better for you to live with me in
heaven than to stay here with my relics."</p>
<p>
When the time of his death was near to Saint Ciaran
in the Little Church, in the thirty-third year of his age,
on the fifth of the ides of September as regards the
solar month, on Saturday as regards the day of the
week, on the eighteenth day as regards the moon, he
said, "Let me be carried out to the Little Height,"
said he. And when he looked at heaven, and the height
of air above his head, he said, "Awful is this road
upward." "Not for thee is it awful," said the monks.
"Truly, I know not," said he, "any of the commandments
of God which I have transgressed: yet even
David son of Jesse, and Paul the apostle, dreaded this
way."</p>
<p>
Then the stone pillow was taken from him, to ease
him. "Nay," said he, "put it under my shoulder.
<i>Qui enim perseuerauerit usque in finem, hic saluus erit.</i>"
Then angels filled the space between heaven and earth
to receive his soul.</p>
<p>
He was brought afterward into the Little Church,
and he raised his hand and blessed his folk, and said
to the brethren to shut the church upon him till Coemgen
should come from Glenn da Locha.</p>
<br />

<h4>L. THE VISIT OF COEMGEN</h4>
<p>
<b>39.</b> When Coemgen came after three days, he received
no full courtesy at first from the clerics, as they were
in great sadness after their head. Said Coemgen to them,<span class="page"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[page 95]</span>
"Let a doleful countenance be upon you continually!"
said he. Then fear took hold of the elders, and they
did the will of Coemgen, and opened the Little Church
to him. The spirit of Ciaran went at once to <a name="il36r" id="il36r"></a>heaven,<a href="#il36"><sup>36</sup></a>
and he returned again into his body to converse with
Coemgen, and welcomed him. From one canonical hour
to the next they were there in converse, and making
a covenant. Thereafter Ciaran blessed Coemgen, and
Coemgen blessed water and made a communion with
Ciaran. And Ciaran gave his bell to Coemgen as a
sign of their league and as a fee for their communion.
That is what is now called the <i>Boban</i> of Coemgen.</p>
<br />

<h4>LII. THE ENVY OF THE SAINTS</h4>
<p>
<b>40.</b> The saints of Ireland were envious of Ciaran for
his excellence, and they put their trust in the King of
Heaven that his life might be shortened. So great was
their envy against him that even his comrade Colum Cille
said, "Blessed be God," said he, "Who hath taken
Saint Ciaran. For had he lived to old age, there would
not have been the place of two chariot-horses found in
Ireland that would not have been his."</p>
<br />

<h4>LIII. A PANEGYRIC ON CIARAN</h4>
<p>
<b>41.</b> Here then is Ciaran with the eight men whom
I have mentioned, and many thousands of saints besides.
Here are the relics of Paul and Peter, which Benen and
Cumlach left in the hollow tree here. Here are the
relics of the blind boy, the disciple of Peca. Here is
the shrine of the guest Peca, whom a certain  devout
man saw borne by angels to the burial of Ciaran. There<span class="page"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[page 96]</span>
were three wonders here that night: the guest-house
being without fire, without guest, without prayer, for
Peca was sufficient of fire, and guest, and prayer.</p>
<p>
There is not one to relate completely what God wrought
of signs and wonders for this holy Ciaran; for they are
more than can be told or mentioned. For after the
coming of Christ in the flesh there was not one born
greater in almsgiving and mercy, greater in labour and
fasting and prayer, greater in humility and fervour
of good-will, greater in courtesy and mildness, greater
in care for the Church of God, greater in daily labour
and in nightly vigil.</p>
<p>
He it is who never put tasty food or heady drink into
his body, from the time when he embraced the religious
life. He it is who never drank milk or ale, till a third
of it was water. He it is who never ate bread, till a third
part of sand was mixed with it. He it is who never
slept save with his side on the bare ground. Beneath
his head was never aught save a stone for a pillow.
Next his skin never came flaxen or woollen stuff.</p>
<p>
A man with choice voluntary full offerings to the
Lord, like Abel son of Adam. A man with zealous
entreaties to God, like Enoch son of Jared. A steersman
full-sufficient for the ark of the Church among the
waves of the world, like Noah son of Lamech. A true
pilgrim with strength of faith and belief, like Abraham
son of Terah. A man loving, gentle, forgiving of heart,
like Moses son of Amram. A man patient and steadfast
in enduring suffering and trouble, like suffering Job.
A psalmist full-tuneful, full-delightful to God, like
David son of Jesse. A dwelling of true wisdom and
knowledge like Solomon son of David. A rock immovable
whereon is founded the Church, like Peter the
apostle. A chief universal teacher and a chosen vessel
for proclaiming truth, like Paul the apostle. A man<span class="page"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[page 97]</span>
full of the grace of the Holy Spirit and of chastity, like
John the breast-fosterling.</p>
<p>
A man full of likeness in many ways to Jesus Christ
the Head of all things. For this man made wine of
water for his folk and his guests in this city, as Jesus
made choice wine of water at the feast of Cana of
Galilee. This man is called "son of the wright," as
Christ is called "Son of the wright" in the Gospel (<i>hic
est Filius fabri</i>, that is, of Joseph). Thirty-three years
in the age of this man, as there are thirty-three years in
the age of Christ. This man arose after three days in his
bed in Cluain to converse with and to comfort Coemgen,
as Christ arose after three days from the grave in
Jerusalem, to comfort and strengthen His mother and
His disciples.</p>
<p>
So for these good things, and for many others, is his
soul among the folk of heaven. His remains and relics
are here with honour and renown, with daily wonders
and miracles. And though great is his honour just now
in this manner, greater shall be his honour in the holy
incorruptible union of his body and his soul in the
great assembly of Judgment, when Saint Ciaran shall
be judge of the fruit of his labour along with Christ
Whom he served. So shall he be in the great assembly,
in the unity of holy fathers and prophets, in the unity
of apostles and disciples of the Saviour Jesus Christ,
in the unity of the nine grades of angels that have transgressed
not, in the unity of the Godhead and Manhood
of the Son of God, in the unity nobler than every other
unity, the Unity of the Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>
I beseech the mercy of the Lofty Omnipotent God,
by the intercession of Saint Ciaran, that we may reach
that unity. May we dwell there, <i>in saecula saeculorum!</i></p>

<h2>ANNOTATIONS TO THE FOREGOING LIVES</h2>

<h4>I. THE HOMILETIC INTRODUCTION (VG)</h4>
<p>
The three Latin lives plunge <i>in medias res</i> at the
beginning; but VG prefixes an introduction borrowed
from a Homily on <i>Charity</i>. The Irish text of this
homily, with the original Latin, will be found printed
from the fifteenth-century MS. called <i>Leabhar Breac</i>
("The speckled book") in Atkinson's <i>Passions and
Homilies</i> (Dublin 1887). The text announced by the
preacher is clearly suggested by incident XXII. It
has already been shown in the Introduction, that this
Life, with its homiletic preface, was a sermon written
to be preached or read on the festival of the saint
(9th September) at Clonmacnois.</p>
<p>
The keynote of the Irish homily is struck in this
first section. It is the work of some scholar of Clonmacnois,
with a warm enthusiasm for the dignity of his
<i>alma mater</i>. The sermon is as much a eulogy of Clonmacnois
as of Ciaran. In the preacher's view, Clonmacnois
is the chief and central church of Ireland, and
the source of all ecclesiastical discipline in the country.
Its founder excelled his fellow-saints as the sun excels
the stars (§ 2). His pre-eminence was recognised by
angels, who relieved him of labour when his turn came
(§ 13): and on several occasions Findian showed a like
favouritism (§§ 18, 20, <i>a</i>, <i>d</i>, 23). Clonmacnois was
superior to the rival house at Birr (§ 20 <i>b</i>); and possessed
in the hide of the Dun Cow an infallible passport to
heaven (§ 20 <i>c</i>). The vision of the tree seen by Enda<span class="page"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[page 99]</span>
and by Ciaran prophesied the pre-eminence of Clonmacnois
(§ 24). The other saints were envious of his
renown and of the glory of his monastery (§ 40).</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Hymn of Colum Cille.</b></i>&mdash;Following the usual
practice of Irish prose literary composition, the homilist
intersperses his work throughout with verse extracts,
appealed to as the authority for the various statements
which he has occasion to make. In the present section
he draws upon a hymn made by Colum Cille in honour
of Ciaran. To this hymn, and to its surviving fragments,
we shall return in commenting upon incident LI,
where the composition of the hymn is alluded to.</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Ante-natal Prophecies.</b></i>&mdash;Patrick is said also to
have prophesied the advent of Senan (LL, 1845<a name="an1r" id="an1r"></a>)<a href="#an1"><sup>1</sup></a> and of
Alban (CS, 505); and Becc mac De that of Brenainn
(LL, 3343). But the parallels drawn between the Life
of Ciaran and that of Christ have made such prophecies
especially appropriate in the present case.</p>
<p>
The prophecy of Saint Patrick took place under the
following circumstances (VTP, p. 84 ff.<a name="an2r" id="an2r"></a>).<a href="#an2"><sup>2</sup></a> The leper
whom, in accordance with a custom frequent in early
Irish monasticism, Patrick is said to have maintained&mdash;partly
for charity and partly for self-abasement&mdash;departed
from Patrick when the latter was on the holy
mountain of Cruachan Aigli (Croagh Patrick, Co.
Mayo). He made his way to the then empty site of<span class="page"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[page 100]</span>
Clonmacnois, and sat in the split trunk of a hollow elm
tree. A stranger made his appearance, and the leper,
having assured himself that he was a Christian, requested
him to uproot a bundle of rushes and to give him in a
clean vessel of the water that would burst forth. Then
the leper begged of the stranger to bring tools for digging,
and to bury him there; and he was the first dead
man to be buried in Clonmacnois. Now after this had
taken place, the nephew of Patrick, Bishop Muinis,
chanced to be benighted on the same spot, when returning
from a mission to Rome on which the apostle had
sent him. There were angels hovering over the leper's
grave, and thus Muinis recognised it as the burial-place
of a man of God. He deposited the relics which he was
bearing back from Rome, for the night, in the hollow
elm; but he found in the morning that the tree had
closed upon them, and that they could not be recovered.
In sorrow for their loss, he related the event to Patrick,
and for his comfort he was told that a Son of Life&mdash;to
wit Ciaran, son of the wright&mdash;was destined to come
thither, and that he would need the relics. These relics
are mentioned in VG 41, though "Benen and Cumlach"
[the leper] are there said to have left them, not Muinis.
From this reference we learn that they were attributed
to Saints Peter and Paul.</p>
<p>
It is quite clear that this curious story has reached
us in a fragmentary and expurgated form, and that if
we had the whole narrative before us it would afford
us an indication that Clonmacnois was the site of an
earlier, Pagan, sanctuary. It will most probably be
found to be an invariable rule that the early Christian
establishments in Ireland occupy the sites of Pagan
sanctuaries; the monastery having been founded to
re-consecrate the holy place to the True Faith. The
hollow elm was doubtless a sacred tree; the well which<span class="page"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[page 101]</span>
miraculously burst forth was a sacred well: the buried
leper may have been a foundation sacrifice, like Oran
on Iona. The old pre-Christian name of the site is
suggestive&mdash;<i>Ard Tiprat</i>, "the high place of the [holy]
well." By no stretch of language can the site of Clonmacnois
be called physically high; as in the stanza
quoted in VG 30, the word <i>Ard</i> must be used in the
sense of distinguished, eminent, or sacred.</p>
<p>
Of the prophecy attributed to Brigit there appears
to be no record in any of her numerous <i>Lives</i>: nor
can I identify with certainty the story of "the fire
and the angel." There were "Crosses of Brigit" at
<a name="an3r" id="an3r"></a>Armagh;<a href="#an3"><sup>3</sup></a> but as there were probably many other
crosses throughout the country dedicated to this popular
saint we cannot infer that Armagh was the scene of the
prophecy.</p>
<p>
Becc mac De was chief soothsayer to King Diarmait
mac Cerrbeil. Very little is certainly known of him;
most of the traditions relating to him consist of tales
of his remarkable gift of foretelling the future&mdash;tales
similar to those related of the Covenanter Alexander
Peden in Scotland, or of the seventeenth-century Mayo
peasant Red Brian <a name="an4r" id="an4r"></a>Carabine.<a href="#an4"><sup>4</sup></a> He died in or about
the year A.D. 555 (the annalists waver between 552
and 557); and the <i>Annals of Clonmacnois</i> tell us that
he began to prophesy in 550. As Ciaran is said to have
died in 548, the statement that Becc mac De foretold
his coming is anachronistic. The prophecy here
attributed to him does not appear in the list of prognostications
attributed to him (given in the MS. Harleian
5280, British Museum, edited in <i>Zeitschrift für</i><span class="page"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[page 102]</span>
<i>Celtische Philologie</i>, ix, 169), or in <i>Leabhar Breac</i>, p. 260,
where some further particulars about him are given.</p>
<p>
I have ventured to emend the passage regarding Becc
mac De slightly, restoring the verse form which the
prophecy seems to have had originally. As it appears
in the <i>Lismore Lives</i> printed text it is given in prose;
an insignificant transposition of the words, and the
taking of the word <i>andsin</i> out of the inverted commas
is all that is <a name="an5r" id="an5r"></a>necessary.<a href="#an5"><sup>5</sup></a> In the rendering in the text
an attempt is made to reproduce to some extent the
elaboration of alliteration, but the end-rhymes and the
vowel-assonances cannot be imitated without sacrificing
the sense. The metre resembles that known as <i>mibhasc</i>
(four-syllable and six-syllable lines alternating, but with
trisyllabic rhyme in the short lines).</p>
<p>
The person to whom Colum Cille uttered his prophecy
was Aed mac Brenainn, Prince of Tethba (Teffia), the
region comprising various baronies in the modern Co.
Westmeath and part of Co. Longford. This Aed gave
Dermag (Durrow) to Colum Cille a few years before the
latter's departure for Scotland. There is, however, no
record of the prophecy in the lives of Colum Cille; probably
his visit to Clonmacnois from Durrow is in the
writer's mind. Ard Abla, identified by O'Donovan with
Lissardowlin, Co. Longford, was in the territory of
Tethba. The Lismore scribe has written the name
of Aed's father incorrectly (Brandub); the correction
("or Brenainn") is a marginal note.</p><br />


<span class="page"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[page 103]</span>
<h4>II. THE ORIGIN AND BIRTH OF CIARAN: THE WIZARD'S
PROPHECIES (LA, LB, LC, VG)</h4>
<p>
<i><b>The Pedigree</b></i> (VG).&mdash;The pedigree in VG traces
Ciaran's descent from Tigernmas, fabled to have reigned
in Tara 3580-3657 <i>Anno Mundi</i> (1620-1543 B.C.<a name="an6r" id="an6r"></a>).<a href="#an6"><sup>6</sup></a>
Through Tigernmas the line is traced to Mil of Spain,
the eponymous ancestor of the "Milesians," or Celtic-speaking
inhabitants of Ireland.</p>
<p>
There is another pedigree, totally different, which
connects the saint, not with the Tara kings, but with
those of the Ulaid or Ulster folk, through the dethroned
Fergus who figures so prominently in the epic tale
<i>Táin Bó Cualnge</i>. This pedigree appears in the <i>Book
of Leinster</i> (facsimile, pp. 348, 349) and <i>Leabhar Breac</i>
(facsimile, p. 16), the Bodleian MS. Rawlinson B 506,
p. 154 <i>d</i>, and in the MS. in Marsh's Library containing
LA, at the foot of the column where LA begins; with
an added note stating that Ciaran was "of the true
Ultonains of Emain": its authenticity is adopted by
Keating (I.T.S. edition, vol. iii, p. 48). Correcting one
copy with another this genealogy runs as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>
Thus both genealogies claim a royal descent for the
saint. This is an instance of a widespread policy, of
which many traces are to be found in the old Irish <span class="page"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[page 104]</span>
Genealogies. The whole country was divided into
territories of different clans, under which were subordinate
and tributary septs. The latter bore the chief
burden of taxation; and they were for the greater part
composed of descendants of the aboriginal pre-Celtic
tribes, who had been reduced to vassalage on the coming
of the Celtic-speaking invaders (about the third or
fourth century B.C.). When a tributary sept became
strong enough to resist the pressure of these imposts,
exemption was claimed by a sort of legal fiction, by
which they were genealogically affiliated to the ruling
sept. This practice led to the fabrication of spurious
links, and even of whole pedigrees.</p>
<p>
In point of fact several indications show that Ciaran
belonged to a tributary sept, and was of pre-Celtic
blood. These tributary septs were distinguished from
their Celtic conquerors by social organisation, racial
character, and probably still to some extent by religion
and language. They had much the same position as
the <i>perioeci</i> in ancient Sparta. The following are the
evidences of his pre-Celtic nationality&mdash;</p>
<p>
(<i><b>a</b></i>) The tribal names of his parents (Latharna, Glasraige).
There are two forms of tribal names in ancient
Ireland; those consisting of two words, and those
consisting of one. The first are in such formulae as
"tribe of NN," "seed of NN" or the like&mdash;NN being
the name of a more or less legendary ancestor. The
second are either simple names which cannot be analysed,
or else are derived from an ancestral name by adding
the suffix <i>-rige</i> or <i>-raige</i>. As a rule the names consisting
of one word only are fundamentally pre-Celtic, or denote
pre-Celtic septs, though in many cases they have been
fitted with Celticising genealogies.</p>
<p>
(<i><b>b</b></i>) The names of Ciaran himself and his brothers,
and of one of his sisters. Donnan, Ciaran, Odran,<span class="page"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[page 105]</span>
Cronan are all diminutives founded upon colours&mdash;the
little brown, black, grey, and tawny one. These indicate
that the family was dark complexioned, which would
also accord with a pre-Celtic origin. The Celts were
fair, their predecessors dark. One of the sisters was
called Pata, with an initial P. This is impossible in a
Gaelic name.</p>
<p>
(<i><b>c</b></i>) The subordinate position of Ciaran's father, and
his liability to taxation. In the <i>Book of Leinster</i> and, in
part, in <i>Leabhar Breac</i>, after the genealogy, we read
"He [<i>i.e.</i> Ciaran] was of one of the seven clans of the
Latharna of Molt. His father was originally in slavery
in Britain; he went thereafter to Ireland to Cenel
Conaill [north of Co. Donegal], and after that to <a name="an7r" id="an7r"></a>Connacht<a href="#an7"><sup>7</sup></a>
to avoid a heavy tax, so that Ciaran was born
at Raith Cremthainn in Mag Ai." LA describes Ciaran's
father as "a rich man," and certainly the family seems
to have been comfortably provided with cattle, the
chief wealth of their time. In reference to his father's
trade Ciaran is regularly called <i>mac in tsáir</i>, "son of
the wright." The Rabelaisian extravaganza called
<i>Imtheacht na Tromdhaimhe</i> ("The Adventures of the
Burdensome Company") introduces Ciaran as himself
practising smith's <a name="an8r" id="an8r"></a>craft;<a href="#an8"><sup>8</sup></a> but no importance can be
attached to so irresponsible a production. Analogous
in this respect are the references to our saint in <i>The
Adventures of Léithin</i><a name="an9r" id="an9r"></a>,<a href="#an9"><sup>9</sup></a> which also introduces Ciaran and
his monks; but as Dr. Hyde points out in his edition,
these are merely a kind of framework for the legend,
and the story, though in itself extremely curious and
interesting, tells us nothing about either Ciaran or<span class="page"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[page 106]</span>
Clonmacnois.</p>
<p>
(<i><b>d</b></i>) The fact, specially mentioned in LA, that Ciaran
was reared by his parents, not put out to fosterage as
would have been done had he been of gentle birth.</p>
<p>
(<i><b>e</b></i>) The pre-eminent position of Ciaran's mother in
the home. The pre-Celtic tribesmen of Ireland, like
their Pictish kinsmen in Scotland, were organised on
the system of mother-right, in which property and
descent and kinship are all traced through the maternal
side of the ancestry. Throughout the <i>Lives</i>, Beoit is a
cypher: the house and its contents and appurtenances
are almost invariably treated as Darerca's property.
Matriarchate usually implies exogamy, a man choosing
his wife from a sept differing from his own; and the
children are related to the mother's, not the father's
kin. The male responsible for the education of the
child is not so much the father as the maternal uncle.
The law of exogamy was strictly followed in the case
before us. Beoit comes from north-east Ulster; Darerca
belonged to a family which drew its origin from the
south-east of the present county Kerry, though she
seems to have settled in Cenel Fiachach at the time
when Beoit met her. Incidents VIII and X of Ciaran's
Life are laid in that territory, which falls in with a tradition,
presently to be noted, that the dwelling-place of
the family of the saint was not Raith Cremthainn,
but the place where the parents had first met&mdash;which
would be an instance of the husband dwelling with the
wife's people, as is frequent under the matriarchate.
The Celtic authors of the <i>Lives</i> have transferred the
kinship of the son to the father's clan, in accordance
with their own social system; but an older tradition
has left an unmistakable trace in the confusion of the
relationships of "father" and "uncle" in LA, §§ 9, 10.</p>
<p>
It is possible that the prominence of the mother in <span class="page"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[page 107]</span>
the household, and Ciaran's birth away from his ancestral
home as the result of a taxation, are specially emphasised
because they offer obvious parallels with the
Gospel story. The character of Darerca is, however,
by no means idealised, as we might have expected it
to be, had this been the chief purpose of the narrator.</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Parents of Ciaran, their Names and Origins.</b></i>&mdash;The
name of Ciaran's father is variously Latinised
in the Latin Lives. The Irish lives call him Beoit,
a name analysed in the <i>Book of Leinster</i>, p. 349, into
<i>Beo-n-Aed</i>, which would mean something like "Living
Fire." The <i>-n-</i> is inserted, according to a law of Old
Irish accidence, because <i>áed</i>, "fire," is a neuter word.
Thus arises the Latin form <i>Beonnadus</i>. By metathesis
the name further becomes transformed to <i>Beodan</i> or
<i>Beoan</i>. The <i>Latharna</i> were the people who dwelt
around the site of the modern town of <i>Larne</i>, which
preserves their name; Mag Molt ("the plain of
wethers") is probably the plain surrounding the town.
The <i>Aradenses</i>, to whom LB ascribes the origin of Beoit,
were the people known in Irish record as <i>Dal n-Araide</i>,
the pre-Celtic people of the region now called Antrim.</p>
<p>
Dar-erca, "daughter of brightness" or "of the
sky," was a common female name in ancient Ireland.
The Glasraige to whom she belonged was a tribe with
divisions scattered in various parts of Ireland. Irluachra
was south-east Kerry with adjoining parts of Cork and
Limerick. Of her poet grandfather Glas nothing is known.</p>
<p>
It would perhaps be too far-fetched to see a hint
at a mythological element in the traditions of Ciaran
in the signification of his parents' names. Indeed,
considering the <i>Tendenz</i> of the Ciaran <i>Lives</i>, it is
remarkable that there is no supernormal element in the
account of the birth of this particular saint; supernatural<span class="page"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[page 108]</span>
births are almost a commonplace in Irish saints'
lives as a rule.</p>
<p>
The saint's own name is regularly spelt with an initial
K or Q in the Latin texts, doubtless because Latin <i>c</i>
was pronounced as <i>s</i> before <i>e</i> and <i>i</i> in mediaeval Ireland.</p>
<p>
The <i>Annals of Clonmacnois</i> preserves for us a totally
different tradition of the origin and upbringing of the
saint. Modernising the haphazard spelling and punctuation
of the seventeenth-century English translation
(the original Irish of this valuable book is lost), we
may note what it tells us. "His father's name was
Beoit, a Connacht man (<i>sic</i>) and a carpenter. His
mother Darerca, of the issue of Corc mac Fergusa mic
Roig of the Clanna Rudraige. He in his childhood
lived with his father and mother in 'Templevickinloyhe'
[wherever that may have been] in Cenel Fiachach;
until a thief of the country of Ui Failge stole the
one cow they had, which, being found, he forsook together
with his father and mother the said place of the stealth
[= theft], fearing of further inconvenience." Here
note: (<b>1</b>) that Darerca is given the ancestry attributed
in the <i>Book of Leinster</i> pedigree to Beoit, thus hinting
at an originally <i>matrilinear</i> form of the official pedigree:
(<b>2</b>) that the settlement of the family in Cenel Fiachach,
<i>i.e.</i> the place of Darerca's dwelling, is definitely stated;
(<b>3</b>) that the migration of the family does not take place
till after Ciaran's birth; (<b>4</b>) that a totally different reason
is assigned for the migration; (<b>5</b>) that incident X of the
<i>Lives</i> is directly referred to; (<b>6</b>) that we hear nothing
in this passage about the rest of the numerous family
of Beoit; and (<b>7</b>) that the family is poor, having but
one cow.</p>
<p>
Cenel Fiachach (the clan of Fiachu) occupied a territory
covering parts of the present counties of Westmeath
and King's Co. VG erroneously writes this Cenel<span class="page"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[page 109]</span>
Fiachrach, which occupied a territory of the modern
Co. Sligo. <i>See</i> further, p. 171.</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Princes.</b></i>&mdash;Unfortunately Ainmire mac Colgain,
lord of Ui Neill, and Cremthann, a chieftain of Connacht,
are not otherwise known; we cannot therefore test the
chronological truth of this part of the story. Ainmire
reappears as an oppressor in the life of Aed (VSH,
ii, 295). LA anachronistically confuses this Ainmire
with Ainmire mac Setna, King of Tara, A.D. 564-566.</p>
<p>
It is noteworthy that VG calls Cremthann "King of
Ireland." This is in accordance with the fact that the
dynasty which united Ireland under the suzerainty of
the King of Tara was of Connacht <a name="an10r" id="an10r"></a>origin.<a href="#an10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>
<i><b>The Wizard's Prophecy.</b></i>&mdash;The phrase "the noise of a
chariot under a king" is a stock formula in this connexion;
compare, with Stokes, <i>Vita Sancti Aedui</i> in
Rees' <i>Lives of Cambro-British Saints</i>, p. 233 (also
VSH, ii, 295). With the incident compare the story
of the druid rising to welcome the parents of Saint
Senan, and when ridiculed for thus showing honour to
peasants explaining that it was to their unborn child
that he was paying honour (LL, 1875). Observe that
in both tales the druid is <i>mocked</i>. This touch doubtless
belongs to the Christian chronicler, taking the opportunity
of putting the minister of the rival creed in an
invidious position.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Deacon Iustus</b></i>, according to VTP (p. 104) and Tirechan's
<i>Collections regarding Saint Patrick</i> (edited in
VTP, see pp. 305, 318) was consecrated by Saint Patrick,
who left with him his ritual book and his office of
baptism, in Fidarta (Fuerty, Co. Roscommon). It was
in his old age that he baptized Ciaran, out of Patrick's<span class="page"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[page 110]</span>
book&mdash;he was, indeed, according to the documents
quoted, no less than 140 years of age. The glossators
of the <i>Martyrology of Oengus</i> (Henry Bradshaw Society
edition, p. 128) confuse him with Euthymius, the
deacon, martyred at Alexandria. The play on words ("it
were fitting that the <i>just one</i> should be baptized by a <i>Just
One</i>") is lost in the Irish version, whence Plummer (VSH,
i, p. xlix) infers that this document is a translation
from a Latin original: but the fact proves nothing
more than that the author of VG borrowed <i>this particular
incident</i>, as he borrowed his preface, from a Latin
writing. All these Lives are patchworks, and their
component elements are of very different origins and
dates.</p>
<p>
<i><b>The date of Ciaran's birth</b></i> was 25 February, A.D. 515.
The <i>Annals of Ulster</i> says 511, or "according to another
book," 516. The <i>Annals of Clonmacnois</i> has the correct
date, 515.</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Geographical Names in this Incident.</b>&mdash;Temoria</i>
(LA) is Tara (Irish <i>Teamair</i>), Co. Meath, the site of
the dwelling of the Kings of Ireland. <i>Midhe</i> (LA)
means the province of Meath; LA is, however, in error
in placing the Latronenses therein. The <i>Connachta</i> are
the people who give their name to the province of
Connacht. <i>Mag Ai</i>, variously spelt, is the central plain
of Co. Roscommon; <i>Raith Cremthainn</i> ("the fort of
Cremthann") was somewhere upon it, presumably
near the royal establishment of Rathcroghan, but the
exact site is unknown. <i>Isel Chiarain</i> (VG), a place
reappearing later in the Life, is unknown, but doubtless
it was close to Clonmacnois. <i>Cluain maccu Nois</i>, the
"Meadow of the Descendants of Nos," now Clonmacnois,
stands on the right bank of the Shannon about twelve
miles below Athlone. Extensive remains of the monastery
founded by Ciaran are still to be seen there. As for<span class="page"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[page 111]</span>
<i>Tech meic in tSaeir</i>, "the house of the wright's son," we
might have inferred that this place was also somewhere
near or in Clonmacnois; but a note among the glosses
of the <i>Martyrology of Oengus</i> (under 9th September)
says that it was "in the house of the son of the wright"
that Ciaran was <i>brought up</i>. It is therefore to be identified
with the mysterious place corruptly spelt "Templevickinloyhe"
(church of the son of the &mdash;&mdash;?) in the
extract from the <i>Annals of Clonmacnois</i> printed <a name="an11r" id="an11r"></a>above.<a href="#an11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>
<i><b>The Verses in this Section of VG.</b></i>&mdash;The epigram on
Ciaran's parents is found in many MSS. The rendering
here given expresses the sense and reproduces the
rhythm of the stanza, but does not attempt to copy
the metre in every detail. This is known as <i>cro cummaisc
etir casbairdne ocus lethrannaigecht</i>, and consists
of seven-syllable lines with trisyllabic rhymes, alternating
with five-syllable lines having monosyllabic
rhymes. Literally translated the sense would run,
"Darerca my mother / she was not a bad woman //
Beoit the wright my father / of the Latharna of Molt."</p>
<p>
The second stanza is misplaced, and should properly
have been inserted in the following paragraph. Its
metre is <i>ae freslige</i>&mdash;seven-syllable lines in a quatrain,
rhyming <i>abab</i>: <i>a</i> being trisyllabic, <i>b</i> dissyllabic rhymes.
The stanza is obscure and probably corrupt; so far as
it can be rendered at all, the literal translation is: "He
healed the steed of Oengus / when he was in a swathe,
in a cradle // there was given &hellip; / from God this
miracle to Ciaran."</p><br />

<span class="page"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[page 112]</span>
<h4>III. HOW CIARAN RAISED THE STEED OF OENGUS
FROM DEATH (LA, LB, LC, VG)</h4>
<p>
<i><b>The Four Versions.</b></i>&mdash;This incident is told in all four
lives, and it is instructive to note the differences of
detail which they display. In LA Oengus goes to
fetch Ciaran, after consulting with his friends. In LB
he sends for him. In LC he goes to him, and in VG
Ciaran comes without being fetched. The stanza
interpolated in the preceding section of VG introduces
us to another variant of the tradition, in which Ciaran
was a swaddled infant when the miracle was wrought.
In LB the incident is given a homiletic turn, by being
told to illustrate the saint's care for animals.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Parallels.</b></i>&mdash;A similar but not identical miracle is
attributed to Saint Patrick (VTP, 228; LL, 565). Here
the saint resuscitates horses with holy water; but in
this case the saint's own curse had originally caused the
horses' deaths, because they grazed in his churchyard.
Saint Lasrian also restored a horse to life (CS, 796).</p>
<p>
<i><b>Tir na Gabrai</b></i> ("the land of the horse") is unknown,
though it presumably was near Raith Cremthainn. The
story was probably told to account for the name of the
field. It has been noticed that the Latin Lives are less
rich in details as to names of places and people than
the Irish Life. This is an indication of a later tradition,
when the recollection of names had become vague, or,
rather, when names which had been of interest to their
contemporaries had ceased to rouse such feelings.</p>
<br />

<h4>IV. HOW CIARAN TURNED WATER INTO HONEY (LA,
LB, LC, VG)</h4>
<p>
One of the numerous imitations of the story of the
Miracle of Cana. Compare incident XLIV. An identical
story is told of Saint Patrick (LL, 108). Note the<span class="page"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[page 113]</span>
variety of reasons given for sending the honey to Iustus.</p>
<br />

<h4>V. HOW CIARAN WAS DELIVERED FROM A HOUND
(LA, LB, LC, VG)</h4>
<p>
<i><b>Parallels.</b></i>&mdash;The same story is told of Saint Patrick,
in Colgan's <i>Tertia Vita</i>, cap. xxxi, <i>Septima Vita</i>, I, cap.
xlvii. Patrick likewise quoted the verse <i>Ne tradas
bestiis animus confitentes tibi</i> (Ps. lxiv, [Vulgate lxiii] 19).</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Fate of the Hound.</b></i>&mdash;This varies in the different
versions. In the Patrick story just quoted it was struck
immovable, as a stone. In LA it thrusts its head <i>in
circo uituli</i>, which I have rendered conjecturally as the
context seems to require, but I can find no information
as to the exact nature of this adjunct to the cattle-stall.
Du Cange gives <i>arcus sellae equestris</i> as one of the
meanings of <i>circus</i>.</p>
<p>
LB and LC, which have many points of affinity, are
in this incident almost word for word identical. They
agree in saying that the men setting on the hound were
spurred (<i>uexati</i>) by an evil spirit. The misplacing of
this incident in LB is probably due to a transposition
of the leaves of the exemplar from which it was copied.</p>
<br />

<h4>VI. HOW CIARAN AND HIS INSTRUCTOR CONVERSED,
THOUGH DISTANT FROM ONE ANOTHER (LA, VG)</h4>
<p>
<i><b>Topography of the Story.</b></i>&mdash;Assuming that Raith
Cremthainn was somewhere near Rathcroghan, the
distance between this and Fuerty would be about
fourteen miles. There is no indication on the Ordnance
map of any rock that can be identified with the cross-bearing
stone on which Ciaran used to sit, though
it clearly was a landmark well known to the author of<span class="page"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[page 114]</span>
LA. (<i>Pacé</i> LA, Rathcroghan is <i>north</i> of Fuerty.)</p>
<p>
<i><b>Parallels.</b></i>&mdash;The closest parallel is the story of Brigit,
who heard a Mass that was being celebrated in Rome,
though unable to hear a popular tumult close by (TT,
539). Something resembling the action of a wireless
telephone is contemplated, the voices being inaudible
to persons between the speakers. Thus the tales of
saints with preternaturally loud voices are not quite
in point. Colum Cille was heard to read his Psalms
a mile and half away (LL, 828); Brenainn also was
heard at a long distance (LL, 3419). The burlesque
<i>Vision of MacConglinne</i> parodies such voices (ed.
Meyer, pp. 12, 13).</p>
<br />

<h4>VII. CIARAN AND THE FOX (VG)</h4>
<p>
<i><b>Parallels.</b></i>&mdash;There are endless tales of how saints
pressed wild animals into their service; indeed the first
monastic establishment of Ciaran's elder namesake,
Ciaran of Saigir, consisted of wild animals only: a boar,
a badger, a wolf, and a stag (VSH, i, 219; <i>Silua Gadelica</i>,
i, p. 1 ff.). Moling also kept a number of wild and tame
animals round his monastery&mdash;among them a fox,
which, as in the tale before us, attempted to eat a book
(VSH, ii, 201); otherwise, however, the stories differ.
Aed rescued a stag from hunters, and used its horns as
a book-rest (VSH, ii, 296); Coemgen similarly rescued a
boar (VSH, i, 244). So, in Wales, Saint Brynach caused
stags to draw his carriage, and committed his cow to
the charge of a wolf (<i>Cambro-British Saints</i>, pp. 10,
296). Saint Illtyd tamed a stag which he had rescued
from hunters (<i>ibid.</i>, pp. 164, 473).</p>
<p>
<i><b>Herding of Cattle.</b></i>&mdash;There is abundant evidence from
the Lives of the saints that the herding of the cattle
while pasturing was an important duty of the children<span class="page"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[page 115]</span>
of the household. There was no little risk in this,
owing to the prevalence of wolves.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Reading the Psalms.</b></i>&mdash;The Psalms seem to have been
the first subject of instruction given to young students;
LB, 4, indicates that Ciaran's lessons with Iustus did
not go beyond the mere rudiments of learning. There
is in the National Museum, Dublin, a tablet-book
containing six leaves of wax-covered wood, on which
are traced a number of the Psalms in the Vulgate
version; this was most likely a lesson-book such as is
here described. The story evidently grew up around an
actual specimen, that bore injuries, explained as being
the tooth-marks of the fox.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Versions of the Tale.</b></i>&mdash;It would appear that this story
was originally an account of how Ciaran and his distant
tutor could communicate, quite independent of incident
VI. It has become awkwardly combined with VI into
a conflate narrative, as is shown by the silence about the
fox in LA. According to the one story, they used their
supernatural "wireless telephone." According to the
other, the fox trotted back and forth with the book.
In the conflate version, it would appear that Iustus
dictated Psalms to Ciaran by "telephone," Ciaran
then wrote them on his tablets, and the fox waited till
he was finished and then carried them for correction
to Iustus. (As is observed in the footnote <i>in loc</i>, p. 73,
we must read "Iustus" for "Ciaran" in the passage
describing the proceedings of the fox).</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Homiletic Pendant.</b></i>&mdash;The unexpected homiletic
turn given to this story in VG may perhaps find its
explanation in facts now lost to us; the passage reads
like a side-thrust at some actual person or persons. It
may possibly refer to the act of sacrilege committed by
Toirdelbach ó Briain, in 1073, who carried away from
Clonmacnois the head of Conchobar ó Maeil-Shechlainn;<span class="page"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[page 116]</span>
but being attacked by a mysterious disease&mdash;imparted
to him, it was said, by a mouse which issued from the
head and ran up under his garment&mdash;he was obliged to
return it, with two gold rings by way of compensation.
He did not recover from the disease, however, but died
in 1086 (<i>Annals of Four Masters</i>).</p><br />


<h4>VIII. HOW CIARAN SPOILED HIS MOTHER'S DYE (VG)</h4>
<p>
I have found no parallel to this most remarkable
story. It displays the following noteworthy points&mdash;</p>
<p>
<b>1.</b> It belongs to the Ciaran-tradition which places the
home of the family in Cenel Fiachach.</p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> It preserves what has every appearance of being
an authentic tradition of a prohibition against the
presence of males, even of tender years, when dyeing
was being carried <a name="an12r" id="an12r"></a>on.<a href="#an12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Most likely the saint's curse&mdash;indeed, the whole
association of the tale with Ciaran&mdash;is a late importation
into the story: it was probably originally a [Pagan]
tale, told as a warning of what would happen if males
were allowed to be present at the mystery. The different
colours which the garments assumed are perhaps not
without significance; Sullivan, in his introduction to
O'Curry's <i>Manners and Customs</i> (i, p. 405), says "the two
failures &hellip; are simply the failures which result from
imperfect fermentation and over-fermentation of the<span class="page"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[page 117]</span>
woad-vat."</p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> There is an intentionally droll touch given to the
end of the <i>Märchen</i>.</p>
<p>
<b>5.</b> The independence of parental control which the
youthful Ciaran displays will not escape notice.</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Stanza.</b></i>&mdash;This is written in a peculiar metre; two
seven-syllable lines, with trisyllabic rhymes, followed
by two rhyming couplets of five-syllable lines with
monosyllabic rhymes.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Iarcain</b></i> is a word of uncertain meaning: it probably
denotes the waste stuff left behind in the vat.</p>
<br />

<h4>IX. HOW CIARAN RESTORED A CALF WHICH A WOLF
HAD DEVOURED (LA, LB, LC, VG)</h4>
<p>
<i><b>Parallels.</b></i>&mdash;Practically the same story is told of Abban
(VSH, i, 24; CS, 508) and of Colman (CS, 828). A similar
story is told of Saint Patrick (LL, 91), but it is not quite
identical, inasmuch as here the wolf voluntarily restored
a sheep which it had carried off. Something like this,
however, is indicated in the Latin verse rendering of
the story (No. 2 of the Latin verse fragments at the
end of LB). More nearly parallel is the tale of Brigit
(LL, 1250; CS, 19) who gave bacon which she was cooking
to a hungry dog; it was miraculously replaced. A
converse of this miracle is to be found in the Life of
Ailbe, who first restored two horses killed by lions, and
then miraculously provided a hundred horses for the
lions to devour (CS, 239). Aed gave eight wethers to
as many starving wolves, and they were miraculously
restored to save him from the indignation of his maternal
aunt (VSH, ii, 296). It is obvious, but hypercritical, to
complain that in these artless tales the kindness shown
to the beasts is illogically one-sided!</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Process of Resuscitation.</b></i>&mdash;The important point<span class="page"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[page 118]</span>
in the tale, though the versions do not all recognise this,
is the collection of the bones of the calf. VG preserves
the essential command to the wolf not to break these.
Colum Cille reconstituted an ox from its bones (LL,
1055). Coemgen gave away to wayfarers the dinner
prepared for the monastic harvestmen, and when the
latter naturally protested, he collected the bones and
re-clothed them with flesh, at the same time turning
water to wine (VSH, i, 238). Aed performed a similar
miracle in the nunnery at Clonmacnois, replacing
Ciaran's dinner which he himself had eaten (VSH, i, 39).
There is here no mention of the bones, but very likely
this has become lost in the process of transmission.
By all these tales we are reminded of the boar Sæhrimnir,
on whose flesh the blessed ones in Valhalla feast
daily&mdash;sodden every evening and reconstituted from its
bones every <a name="an13r" id="an13r"></a>morning.<a href="#an13"><sup>13</sup></a> In a Breton folk-tale, <i>La
princesse Troïol</i>, the hero has been burnt by the wiles
of his enemy, but his sorceress fiancée seeks among
the ashes till at last she finds a tiny splinter of bone.
With this she is able to restore her betrothed; without
it she would have been <a name="an14r" id="an14r"></a>powerless.<a href="#an14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>
Very probably the practice of "secondary interment"
of human bones, which we find so far back as the later
stages of the Palaeolithic age, is based upon the same
belief; that if the bones are preserved, their owner has
a chance of a fresh lease of life.</p>
<p>
There is a curious variant of the story in the Life of
Coemgen. Here the cow is driven home, and Coemgen,
called upon to soothe its lamentations, fetches, not the
bones of the eaten calf, but the culprit wolf, which<span class="page"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[page 119]</span>
comes and plays the part of the calf to the satisfaction
of all concerned (VSH, i, 239). It is evident that in this
case there is another element of belief indicated: the
personality of the calf has passed into the wolf which
has devoured it&mdash;in fact, the wolf <i>is</i> the calf re-incarnate.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Resurrection of Beasts.</b></i>&mdash;Calling dead animals back to
life is a not infrequent incident in the lives of Irish
saints. We have already seen Ciaran resuscitating a
horse. Mo-Chua restored twelve stags (VSH, ii, 188);
but perhaps the most remarkable feat was that of
Moling, who, having watched a wren eating a fly, and
a kestrel eating the wren, revived first the wren
and then the fly (VSH, ii, 200). Saint Brynach's cow
having been slain by a tyrannical king, was restored
to life by the saint (<i>Cambro-British Saints</i>, pp. 11, 297).</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Stanza in VG.</b></i>&mdash;The metre is <i>ae freslige</i>. The
rendering in the text is close to the literal sense.</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Ejaculation "Mercy on us"</b></i>&mdash;or, more literally,
"mercy come to us." The sentence recording this
habitual ejaculation, in VG, breaks so awkwardly into
the sense of the passage in which it is found, that it
must be regarded as a marginal gloss which has become
incorporated with the text. It has dislodged a sentence
that must have legitimately belonged to the text,
restored in the foregoing translation by conjecture.
Probably the lost sentence, like the intrusive one,
ended with the word <i>trocuire</i>, "mercy," which, indeed,
may have suggested the interpolation; this
might easily have caused the scribe's eye to wander.
An habitual expletive is also attributed to St. Patrick
(<i>modébroth</i>, apparently "My God of Judgment!").</p>
<p>
Here, again, the versions in LB and LC are very
closely akin.</p><br />

<span class="page"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[page 120]</span>
<h4>X. HOW CIARAN WAS DELIVERED FROM ROBBERS
(LA, LC, VG)</h4>
<p>
<i><b>Parallels.</b></i>&mdash;Robbers were smitten with blindness (cf.
Genesis xix. II) by Darerca (CS, 179) and restored on
repentance. The same fate befell a man who endeavoured
to drive Findian from a place where he had settled
(CS, 198). Robbers who attempted to attack Cainnech
(CS, 364, 389; VSH, i, 153), Colman (VSH, i, 264),
and Flannan (CS, 669), were struck motionless. The
story before us is a conflation of the two types of incident,
blindness and paralysis being accumulated on
the robbers. The same accumulation befell a swineherd
who attempted to slay Saint Cadoc (<i>Cambro-British
Saints</i>, pp. 31, 321).</p>
<p>
Note that this incident, like No. VIII, belongs to the
Cenel Fiachach tradition. We have already seen that
it was known to the compiler of the <i>Annals of Clonmacnois</i>,
though he ignores the miraculous element.</p>
<br />

<h4>XI.-XIII. HOW CIARAN GAVE CERTAIN GIFTS (LA):
XIV. HOW CIARAN GAVE THE KING'S CAULDRON
TO BEGGARS AND WAS ENSLAVED (LA, LC, VG)</h4>
<p>
These four incidents may be considered together:
they are all variants of one formula.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Parallels.</b></i>&mdash;Brigit took "of her father's wealth and
property, whatsoever her hands would find, &hellip; to
give to the poor and needy" (LL, 1308). A story is
told in the Life of Aed which is evidently a combination
of our incidents XII and XIII: to the effect that
when ploughing he made a gift of one of his oxen and
of the coulter, and continued to plough without either
(VSH, i, 36).</p>
<p>
The angels grinding for Ciaran reappear in incident
XVIII: this is a frequent type of favour shown to<span class="page"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[page 121]</span>
saints. Angels ground for Colum Cille at Clonard (LL,
850), swept out a hearth for Patrick (LL, 121), and
harvested for Ailbe (CS, 241).</p>
<p>
<i><b>Beoit an Uncle.</b></i>&mdash;This is an important link between
incidents XII and XIII in LA. Its bearing upon the
question of the origin of Ciaran's family has already
been noticed.</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Oxen ploughing.</b></i>&mdash;Incident XIII would be
meaningless if we did not understand from it that at
the time of the formation of the story it was not customary
to use horses in the plough. This is an illustration
of the way in which these documents, unhistorical
though they may be in the main, yet throw occasional
sidelights, which may be accepted as authentic, on
ancient life.</p>
<p>
<i><b>King Furbith.</b></i>&mdash;I have not succeeded in tracing this
personage, who reappears in incident XXVII. But the
story of his cauldron is found in the Life of Ciaran of
Saigir (CS, 815), in a rather different form&mdash;to the effect
that he deposited his considerable wealth for safe-keeping
with Ciaran, who was already abbot of Clonmacnois.
Ciaran promptly distributed it to the poor.
Furbith was human enough to be annoyed at this breach
of trust, and ordered Ciaran to be summoned before him
in bonds. This done, he addressed him "insultingly,"
as the hagiographer puts it, in these words: "Good
abbot, if thou wilt be loosed from bonds, thou must
needs bring me seven white-headed red hornless <a name="an15r" id="an15r"></a>kine:<a href="#an15"><sup>15</sup></a>
and if thou canst not find them, thou shalt pay a penalty
for my treasures which thou hast squandered." Ciaran
undertook to provide the required cattle, "not to escape
these thy bonds, which are a merit unto me, but to set<span class="page"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[page 122]</span>
forth the glory of my God"; and therefore he was set
free to obtain them. Another variant of these stories&mdash;a
common type, in which the saint gives away the
property of other people in alms, but has his own face
miraculously saved&mdash;is illustrated by the tale of
Coemgen, who, when a boy was pasturing sheep. He
gave four of them to beggars, but when the sheep were
led home at night the number was found complete
"so that the servant of Christ should not incur trouble
on account of his exceeding charity" (VSH, i, 235).</p>
<p>
The site of <i>Cluain Cruim</i> (LA) is unknown (perhaps
Clooncrim, Co. Roscommon). The <i>Desi</i> (VG), or Dessi,
were a semi-nomadic pre-Celtic people once established
in the barony of Deece, Co. Meath, but afterwards in
the baronies of Decies in Waterford: both these baronies
still bear their name. A branch of them settled in Wales.
Evidently the donors of the cauldrons which purchased
the freedom of the saint were of the Decies; they are
said to have been Munster folk (the name of the province
is variously spelled).</p>
<br />

<h4>XV. HOW CIARAN REPROVED HIS MOTHER (LA, LC)</h4>
<p>
I have found no parallel to this story; it contains no
miraculous element, and may quite possibly be at least
founded on fact. Its chief importance is the prominence
given to the <i>materfamilias</i>.</p>
<br />

<h4>XVI. THE BREAKING OF THE CARRIAGE-AXLE (LA, LC)</h4>
<p>
Unlike LA, LC seems to imply that the injury to the
axle was not repaired. This would be parallel to the
story of Aed, who, when his carriage met with a similar
mishap, was able to continue his journey on one wheel
only (CS, 336; VSH, i, 36).</p><br />

<span class="page"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[page 123]</span>
<h4>XVII. HOW CIARAN WENT WITH HIS COW TO THE
SCHOOL OF FINDIAN (LA, LB, LC, VG)</h4>
<p>
<i><b>The blessing of the Cow.</b></i>&mdash;In this story we again note
the prominence of the <i>materfamilias</i>: it is she who in
most of the versions withholds the desired boon. Note
how LB endeavours to tone down the disobedience of
the saint by making the cow follow him of her own
accord, or, rather, upon a direct divine command. The
<i>Annals of Clonmacnois</i> presents the story in a similar
form: "He earnestly entreated his parents that they
would please to give him the cow [which had been stolen
and recovered; <i>ante</i>, p. 108], that he might go to school
to Clonard to Bishop Finnan, where Saint Colum Cille
&hellip; and divers others were at school: which his parents
denied: whereupon he resolved to go thither as poor
as he was, without any maintenance in the world. The
cow followed him thither with her calf; and being more
given to the cause of his learning than to the keeping
of the cows, having none to keep the calf from the cow,
[he] did but draw a strick of his bat between the calf and
cow. The cow could not thenceforth come no nearer [<i>sic</i>]
the calf than to the strick, nor the calf to the cow, so
as there needed no servant to keep them one from
another but the strick." A totally different version of
the story of the cow is recorded in the glosses to the
<i>Martyrology of Oengus</i> (9th September). Here Ciaran
applied to his <i>father</i>, who, so far from refusing his request,
bade him go through the herd and take whatever beast
would follow him. "The Dun Cow of Ciaran" yielded
to the test. Further, the same cow followed him when
he left Clonard, instead of remaining with Ninned as in
the <i>Lives</i> before us.</p>
<p>
Note how the author of LA has been unable to keep
a very human touch out of his arid record: <i>matri
displicebat, uolebat enim eum secum semper habere</i>. This<span class="page"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[page 124]</span>
is our last glimpse of poor Darerca, and it does much
to soften the rather lurid limelight in which our homilists
place her.</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Division of Kine and Calves.</b></i>&mdash;This miracle is
one of the most threadbare commonplaces of Irish
hagiographical literature; it is most frequently, as
here, performed by drawing a line on the ground between
the animals with the saint's wonder-working
staff. It is attributed, <i>inter alia</i>, to Senan (LL, 1958),
Fintan (CS, 229), Ailbe (with swine, CS, 240), and Finan
(CS, 305).</p>
<p>
<i><b>A miraculous abundance of milk</b></i> was also given by
kine belonging to Brigit (CS, 44) and to Samthann
(VSH, ii, 255).</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Hide of the Cow.</b></i>&mdash;Plummer quotes other illustrations
of such mechanical passports to the Land of the
Blessed (VSH, i, p. xciii). The main purpose of this
whole incident is doubtless to explain the origin of a
precious relic, preserved at Clonmacnois. Its history
is involved in some doubt: it is complicated by the
fact that there exists a well-known manuscript, now
preserved in the library of the Royal Irish Academy,
written at Clonmacnois about A.D. 1100, and called the
<i>Book of the Dun Cow</i>, from the animal of whose hide the
vellum is said to have been made. But whether this
book has any connexion with the Dun Cow of Ciaran
may be considered doubtful. For down to the comparatively
late date at which our homilies were put
together, the hide of Ciaran's Dun was evidently
preserved <i>as a hide</i>, on or under which a dying man
could lie: therefore it cannot have been made into a
book. Yet <i>Imtheacht na Tromdhaimhe</i> (p. 124 of the
printed text) tells us, for what it may be worth, that
Ciaran wrote the great epic tale called <i>Táin Bó Cúalnge</i>
upon the hide of the Dun Cow. There is actually a<span class="page"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[page 125]</span>
copy of this tale in the existing book; but the book was
written not long after the time when our homilists were
describing the relic as an unbroken hide. Either there
were two dun cows, or the name of the Manuscript has
arisen from a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>
<i><b>The stanza in VG</b></i> is another example of <i>ae freslige</i>
metre. The literal translation is "Fifty over a hundred
complete / the Dun of Ciaran used to feed, // guests
and lepers / people of the refectory and of the parlour."</p>
<p>
<i><b>The School of Findian.</b></i>&mdash;Findian was born in the fifth
century. He went to Tours for study, and afterwards
to Britain; he then felt a desire to continue his studies
in Rome, but an angel bade him return to Ireland
and there continue the work begun by Patrick. After
spending some time with Brigit at Kildare, and establishing
various religious houses, he settled at Cluain
Iraird, in the territory of Ui Neill: now called Clonard,
in Co. Meath. His establishment there became the
chief centre of instruction in Ireland in the early part
of the sixth century. He died in 549, at an advanced
age: indeed, he is traditionally said to have lived 140
years. Nothing now remains of the monastery, though
there were some ruins a hundred years ago.</p>
<br />

<h4>XVIII. THE ANGELS GRIND FOR CIARAN (LA, LC, VG)</h4>
<p>
The angels grinding have already been seen in incident
XIV.</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Stanza in VG.</b></i>&mdash;This is in the metre known as
<i>rannaigecht mór</i>, seven syllables with monosyllabic
rhymes, usually <i>abab</i>. The translation adequately
expresses the sense and, approximately, the <a name="an16r" id="an16r"></a>metre.<a href="#an16"><sup>16</sup></a> The
number of saints enumerated is thirteen, not twelve, but
the master, Findian of Clonard, is not counted in the <span class="page"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[page 126]</span>
reckoning. The names, the principal monasteries, and
the obits of these saints are as follows&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent3a">
Findian of Cluain Iraird (Clonard, Co. Meath), 12 December 548.<br />
Findian of Mag-bile (Moville, Co. Donegal), 12 September 579.<br />
Colum Cille of Í Choluim Cille (Iona), 9 June 592.<br />
Colum of Inis Cealtra (Holy Island, Loch Derg), 13 December 549.<br />
Ciaran of Cluain maccu Nois (Clonmacnois), 9 September 548.<br />
Cainnech of Achad Bo (Aghaboe, Queen's Co.), 11 October 598.<br />
Comgall of Beannchor (Bangor, Co. Down), 10 May 552.<br />

Mo-Laise mac  Nad-Fraeich  of Daimhinis (Devenish, Loch Erne), 12 September 563.</p>
<br />


<h4>XIX. CIARAN AND THE KING'S DAUGHTER (LA, VG)</h4>
<p>
<i><b>Parallels.</b></i>&mdash;Maignenn never would look on a woman,
"lest he should see her guardian devil" (<i>Silua Gadelica</i>,
i, 37). The story has some affinity with the curious
<i>Märchen</i> of the Mill and the Bailiff's Daughter (incident
XXIV). Cuimmin of Connor, in his poem on the characters
of the different Irish saints, spoke thus of Ciaran,
doubtless in reference to this incident: "Holy Ciaran
of Clonmacnois loved humility that he did not abandon
rashly; he never spoke a word that was untrue, he
never looked at a woman from the time when he was
born."</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Stanza in VG.</b></i>&mdash;Metre <i>ae freslige</i>. Literally
thus: "With Ciaran read / a girl who was stately with
treasures // and he saw not / her form or her shape or
her make."</p>
<p>
In LA the father of the maiden is king in Tara: in
VG he is king of Cualu, the strip of territory between the
mountains and the sea from Dublin southward to Arklow.</p>
<br />
<span class="page"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[page 127]</span>

<h4>XX. HOW CIARAN HEALED THE LEPERS (VG)</h4>
<p>
Leprosy, or at least a severe cutaneous disease so
called, was common in ancient Ireland; and there are
numerous stories, some of them extremely disagreeable,
that tell how the saints associated with its victims as
an act of self-abasement. We have already seen how
Patrick was said to have kept a leper. Brigit also
healed lepers by washing (LL, 1620), and Ruadan cleansed
lepers with the water of a spring that he opened miraculously
(VSH, ii, 249). Contrariwise, Munnu never
washed except at Easter after contracting leprosy
(VSH, ii, 237). The miraculous opening of a spring is a
common incident in Irish hagiography; we have already
seen an example, in the annotations to incident I.</p>
<p>
Whitley Stokes points out (LL, note <i>ad loc.</i>) that the
"three waves" poured over the lepers are suggested
by the triple immersion in baptism.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXI. CIARAN AND THE STAG (VG)</h4>
<p>
<i><b>Parallels.</b></i>&mdash;We have already noted the use of wild
animals by Irish saints. Findian yoked stags to draw
wood (LL, 2552). Patrick kept a tame stag (TT, p. 28,
cap. lxxxii, etc.). In incident XXXVII, Ciaran is
again served by a stag. Cainnech, like Ciaran, made a
book-rest of the horns of a stag (CS, 383), and books
which Colum Cille had lost were restored to him by a
stag (TT, <i>Quinta Vita</i>, p. 407). In the life of Saint
Cadoc we read an incident which combines docile stags
drawing timber and a forgotten book untouched by
rain (<i>Cambro-British Saints</i>, pp. 38, 329).</p>
<p>
For Ciaran's prompt obedience to the summoning
sound of the bell, compare what is told of Cainnech,
who happened to be summoned by the head of the
monastic school when he was writing, and left the letter
O, which at the moment he was tracing, unfinished, to<span class="page"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[page 128]</span>
obey the call (VSH, i, 153).</p>
<p>
There is a parallel in incident XXXVI for the book
unwet by rain. Books written by Colum Cille could
not be injured by water (LL, 956). It is perhaps hardly
necessary to infer with Plummer (VSH, i, p. cxxxviii)
that this was a myth of solar origin.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXII. THE STORY OF CIARAN'S GOSPEL (LA, VG)</h4>
<p>
This striking anecdote is unique, and probably founded
on an authentic incident. The two versions before us
differ in some respects, as a comparison will show.
The story is told in another form in the <i>Quinta Vita
Columbae</i> (TT, p. 403) to the effect that "Once Saint
Kieranus, whom they call the Son of the Wright, on
being asked, promised Columba that as he was writing
a book of the Holy Gospels, he would write out the
middle part of the book. Columba, in gratitude to him,
said, 'And I,' said he, 'on behalf of God, promise and
foretell that the middle regions of Ireland shall take
their name from thee, and shall bring their taxes or
tribute to thy monastery.'" The same version appears
in O'Donnell's <i>Life of Colum Cille</i> (printed text, p. 128).
Yet another version appears in the glosses to the
<i>Martyrology of Oengus</i> (9th September), according to
which Colum Cille wished to write a gospel-book, but
no one except Ciaran had an exemplar from which to
make the copy. Colum Cille went to Ciaran's cell and
asked for the loan of the book; Ciaran, who was preparing
his lesson, and had just come to the words <i>Omnia
quaecumque</i>, etc., presented him with it. "Thine be
half of Ireland!" said Colum Cille. It is worth passing
notice that the verse in question, here treated as the
central verse of the gospel, is not one-fifth of the way<span class="page"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[page 129]</span>
through the book. Had the original narrator of the
tale a copy with misplaced or missing leaves?</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Stanza in VG.</b></i>&mdash;This is apparently slightly
corrupt, but the metre is evidently meant to be <i>ae
freslige</i>. It probably belongs to one poem with the
previous stanzas in the same metre: its first line
echoes the stanza in incident XIX. Literally, "With
Findian read / Ciaran the pious, with diligence // he
had half a book without reading / half of Ireland his
thereafter."</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Saying of Alexander.</b></i>&mdash;I regret to have to acknowledge
that I have been unable to get on the track of any
explanation of this appendix to the incident, as related
in VG. It is probably a marginal gloss taken into the
text. The "Alexander" is presumably one of the popes
of that name, and if so, must be Alexander II (1061-1073),
as the first Pope Alexander is too early, and the
remaining six are too late. I have, however, searched
all the writings bearing his name without discovering
anything like this saying, nor can I trace it with the
aid of the numerous indexes in Migne's <i>Patrologia</i>.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXIII. THE BLESSING OF CIARAN'S FOOD (LA, LC)</h4>
<p>
I cannot find any authority for the ritual indicated
by this curious story, in which the blessing of a second
person is necessary before food can be consumed.
There is a Jewish formula described by <a name="an17r" id="an17r"></a>Lightfoot,<a href="#an17"><sup>17</sup></a> in
which, when several take their meals together, one says
<i>Let us bless</i>, and the rest answer <i>Amen</i>. But it is not
clear why a response should have been required by a
person eating alone.</p><br />

<span class="page"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[page 130]</span>
<h4>XXIV. THE STORY OF THE MILL AND THE BAILIFF'S
DAUGHTER (LB, VG)</h4>
<p>
The full details of this narrative have evidently been
offensive to the author of LB, who has heroically bowdlerised
it. It is obviously an independent <i>Märchen</i>, which
has become incorporated in the traditions of Ciaran.</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Famine.</b></i>&mdash;Famines are frequently recorded in
the Irish Annals: and it is noteworthy that they were
usually accompanied by an epidemic of raids on monasteries.
The wealth of the country was largely concentrated
in these establishments, so that they presented
a strong temptation to a starving community. The
beginning of the story is thus quite true to nature and
to history, though I have found no record of a famine
at the time when we may suppose Ciaran to have been
at Clonard.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Transformation of Oats to Wheat, and of other Food
to Flour.</b></i>&mdash;Such transformations are common in the
saints' Lives. We read of swine turned to sheep
(CS, 879), snow to curds (LL, 127), sweat to gold (TT,
398) flesh to bread (CS, 368). The later peculiarities of
the food&mdash;bread or some other commonplace material
having the taste of more recondite dainties, and possessing
curative properties&mdash;are not infrequently met with
in folk-lore. Saint Illtyd placed fish and water before
a king, who found therein the taste of bread and salt,
wine and mead, in addition to their proper savours
(<i>Cambro-British Saints</i>, pp. 165, 474).</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Resistance of the Saint to amorous Advances.</b></i>&mdash;The
reader may be referred to Whitley Stokes's note <i>ad
loc.</i>, in LL. We may recall the well-known story of
Coemgen (Kevin) at Glendaloch: though it must be
added that the version of the tale popularised by Moore,
in which the saint pushed his importunate pursuer into
the lake and drowned her, has no ancient authority.
On the rather delicate subject of the arrangement made<span class="page"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[page 131]</span>
between Ciaran and the maiden's family, consult the
article <i>Subintroductae</i> in Smith and Cheetham's <i>Dictionary
of Christian Antiquities</i>. This feature of the
story is enough to show its unhistorical character, at
least so far as Ciaran is concerned: for Ciaran did not
belong to the <i>Primus Ordo</i> of Irish saints, who <i>mulierum
administrationem et consortia non respuebant, quia super
petram Christum fundati ventum temptationis non timebant</i>,
but to the <i>Secundus Ordo</i>, who <i>mulierum consortia
et administrationes fugiebant, atque a monasteriis suis
eas excludebant</i> (CS, 161, 162). The description of
Ciaran as transcending his contemporaries in beauty is
probably suggested by Ps. xlv, 2, and is another
illustration of the <i>Tendenz</i> already referred to.</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Eavesdropper and the Crane.</b></i>&mdash;This incident
reappears in the Life of Flannan (CS, 647). Wonder-workers
do not like to be spied upon by unauthorised
persons. This is especially true in the Fairy mythology
surviving to modern times. Compare a tale in
the Life of Aed (VSH, ii, 308). A quantity of wood had
been cut for building a church, but there was no available
labour. Angels undertook the work of transportation
on condition that no one should spy upon them.
One man, however, played the inevitable "Peeping
Tom," and the work ceased immediately. The reader
may be referred for further instances to the essay on
"Fairy Births and Human Midwives" in E.S. Hartland's
<i>Science of Fairy Tales</i>.</p>
<p>
There is a touch of intentional drollery at the end of
the story where the brethren are shown as having so
thoroughly enjoyed the feast miraculously provided
for them that their observance of the canonical hours
was disjointed. For other instances of intoxication
as resulting from saints' miracles see VSH, i, p. ci.</p>
<span class="page"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[page 132]</span>
<p>
<i><b>The Stanzas in VG.</b></i>&mdash;These are in <i>ae freslige</i> metre,
so that they are probably another fragment of the poem
already met with. The translation in the text reproduces
the sense with sufficient literalness.</p>
<p>
On the whole the impression which this unusually
long and very confused incident makes on the reader
is that originally it was an <i>anti-Christian</i> narrative
concocted in a Pagan circle, which has somehow become
superficially Christianised.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXV.  THE STORY OF CLUAIN (VG)</h4>
<p>
One of the numerous tales told of the danger of
crossing the will of a saint. It is possibly suggested by
Matt, xxi, 28; but it may also be a pre-Christian folk-tale
adapted to the new Faith by substituting a saint
for a druid. On the cursing propensities of Irish saints
see Plummer, VSH, i, pp. cxxxv, clxxiii. A curse said
to have been pronounced by Ciaran on one family
remained effective down to the year 1151, where it is
recorded by the <i>Annals of the Four Masters</i> (vol. ii,
p. 1096). Another curse of the same saint, and its
fulfilment, is narrated in Keating's History (Irish Texts
Society's edn., iii, 52 ff.), and at greater length in the life
of the victim, Cellach (<i>Silua Gadelica</i>, no. iv).</p>
<p>
Note that Ciaran sends a messenger with his rod to
revive Cluain. This is probably imitated from Elisha
sending Gehazi similarly equipped to raise the Shunammite's
son (2 Kings iv, 29).</p>
<p>
Cluain's thanks at being delivered from the pains of
hell may be contrasted with the protest of the monk
resurrected by Colman (VSH, i, 260, 265) at being
recalled from the joys of heaven&mdash;an aspect of resurrection
stories frequently overlooked by the narrators.</p>
<span class="page"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[page 133]</span>
<p>
<i><b>The Stanza in VG.</b></i>&mdash;The metre is <i>rannaigecht gairit
dialtach</i> (a line of three syllables followed by three of
seven, with monosyllabic rhymes <i>aaba</i>). The literal
rendering is "Cluain agreed to come / to me to-day
for reaping // for an oppressive disease / caused him
living in his house to be dead."</p>
<br />

<h4>XXVI, XXVII. HOW CIARAN FREED WOMEN FROM
SERVITUDE (LA, LB, VG)</h4>
<p>
Tuathal Moel-garb ("the bald-rough") was king in
Tara A.D. 528-538. We have already met with Furbith
in incident XIV.</p>
<p>
Interceding for captives, with or without miracle,
was one of the most frequent actions attributed to
Irish saints: as for instance Brigit (LL, 1520) and
Fintan (CS, 300). Doors opened of their own accord
to Colum Cille (CS, 850). Paulinus of Nola gave himself
as a captive in exchange for a widow's son at the time
of the invasion of Alaric in A.D. 410 (see Smith's <i>Dictionary
of Christian Biography</i>, vol. iv, p. 239, col. ii,
and references there). This explains the allusion in
LB. The woman passing through her enemies is
perhaps suggested by Luke iv, 30. The prisoner
Fallamain, rescued by Saint Samthann, also passed
unscathed through a crowd of jailers (VSH, ii, 255;
compare <i>ibid.</i>, p. 259); his chains opened of their own
accord, like the doors in incident XXVI. Compare
Acts xii, 7 ff.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXVIII. ANECDOTES OF CLUAIN IRAIRD (VG)</h4>
<p>
These four <i>petits conies</i>, found in VG only, are clearly
designed to set forth the superiority of Clonmacnois
above its rival establishments.</p>
<span class="page"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[page 134]</span>
<p>
(<i><b>a</b></i>) This story tells how Findian ranked Ciaran above
all the notable saints and scholars of his time, and how
they had to acknowledge his pre-eminence by their
very jealousy. Colum Cille is the only saint whom the
homilist will allow to approach his hero.</p>
<p>
(<i><b>b</b></i>) This is a thrust at the monastery of Birr. It
says, in effect, "Clonmacnois is situated on the great
river Shannon, Birr on the insignificant Brosna; and
the relative importance of the two establishments is to
be estimated by the size of their respective rivers&mdash;even
Brenainn, the founder of Birr, said this himself!"
There was a contest between the people of Clonmacnois
and those of Birr at a place now unknown, <i>Moin Coise
Bla</i> (the bog at the foot of Bla) in the year 756, according
to the <i>Annals of Clonmacnois</i> and of <i>Tigernach</i>.
The circumstances which led to this event are not on
record; but it is not far-fetched to see an echo of it in
the story before us. This would give us an approximate
date for the construction of the story, though the
compilation in which it is now embedded is considerably
later.</p>
<p>
(<i><b>c</b></i>) This story further exalts Clonmacnois as the place
containing a valuable relic that ensures eternal happiness
in the hereafter. Of this relic we have already spoken.</p>
<p>
(<i><b>d</b></i>) Again exalts Clonmacnois by relating a dream
in which the founder is put on a level with the great
Colum Cille. This vision is related also in the Lives of
the latter saint (see, for instance, LL, 852). An analogous
vision, not related in the Lives of Ciaran, is that of
the three heavenly chairs, seen by Saint Baithin. He
saw a chair of gold, a chair of silver, and a chair of
crystal before the Lord. As interpreted by Colum Cille,
the first was the seat destined for Ciaran, on account of
the nobility and firmness of his faith; the silver chair
was for Baithin, on account of the firmness and brightness
and rigour of his faith; and the third was for <span class="page"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[page 135]</span>
Colum Cille himself, on account of the brightness and
purity&mdash;and brittleness&mdash;of his <a name="an18r" id="an18r"></a>faith.<a href="#an18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<br />

<h4>XXIX. THE PARTING OF CIARAN AND FINDIAN (VG)</h4>
<p>
Compare with this narrative the parting of Senan
and Notal (LL, 2031). The metre of the stanza is
<i>cummasc etir rannaigecht mór ocus leth-rannaigecht</i>
(seven-syllable and five-syllable lines alternately, with
monosyllabic rhymes <i>abab</i>). The translation is literal.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXX. THE ADVENTURES OF THE ROBBERS OF LOCH ERNE (LB, LC)</h4>
<p>
LA and VG know nothing of the visit to Loch Erne
of which this is the chief incident. Ninned here appears
as an abbot, which is scarcely consistent with his
previous appearance as a junior fellow-student of
Ciaran. There is, however, a possible hint at this
tradition in the statement in VG that when Ciaran
departed from Clonard he left the Dun Cow with Ninned.
Ninned's island, as we learn from an entry in the
<i>Martyrology of Donegal</i> (18th January) was Inis Muighe
Samh, now spelt Inismacsaint, in Loch Erne. The
reading in both MSS. of LB, <i>silua</i> for <i>insula</i>, evidently
rests on a false interpretation of a word or a contraction
in the exemplar from which R1 was copied. This
seems to have been hard to read at the incident before
us. Later on there is a word, which the sense shows
us must have been <i>potentes</i>. The scribe of R1 could not
read it, and left a blank, which he afterwards tentatively
filled in with the meaningless word <i>fatentes</i>&mdash;a
word which his copyist, the scribe of R2, emended by <span class="page"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[page 136]</span>
guesswork into <i>fac(i)entes</i>.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Parallels.</b></i>&mdash;There are several cases of the restoration
to life of persons who had been decapitated. Coemgen
restored two women who had been thus treated (VSH, i,
239). The famous Welsh holy well of Saint Winefred
in Flintshire is associated with a similar miracle (see
Rees' <i>Cambro-British Saints</i>, pp. 17, 304). The story
of the three murdered monks is also told of Saint Aed
(VSH, i, 38), but there the blood-mark round their necks
is absent. Ciaran seems to have been less expert than
some of his brethren in replacing severed heads on
decapitated bodies; for according to a tale preserved
in the <i>Book of Lismore</i>, there was a certain lord of the
region of Ui Maine (the region west of the Shannon),
who was called Coirpre the Crooked, for the following
reason: he was an evil man who did great mischief to
every one, in consequence of which he was murdered
and beheaded. But Ciaran had shriven him, and in
order to deliver his soul from demons he restored him to
life, replacing his head&mdash;so clumsily, however, that it
was ever afterwards crooked.</p>
<p>
A certain man called Ambacuc, having perjured himself
on the hand of Ciaran, his head fell off. He was
taken to Clonmacnois, and not only lived there headless
for seven years, but became the father of a <a name="an19r" id="an19r"></a>family!<a href="#an19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<br />

<h4>XXXI. HOW CIARAN FLOATED A FIREBRAND ON THE
LAKE (LB)</h4>
<p>
<i><b>The Harbour of the Island.</b></i>&mdash;It must be remembered,
in reading this and other island stories, that as a rule
"the harbour of the island" is not, as might be expected,<span class="page"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[page 137]</span>
the landing-stage on the island itself, but the port on
the mainland from which ships depart to visit the island.
Thus Portraine, a place on the coast north of Dublin,
is properly <i>Port Rachrann</i>, the Port of Rachra&mdash;the
port from which voyagers sailed to Rachra, the island
now called by its Norse name Lambay.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Parallels.</b></i>&mdash;I have not found an exact parallel, but
the story belongs to the same family as that related of
Coemgen, who kindled a fire with the drops of water
that fell from his fingers after washing his hands (CS,
839).</p>
<br />

<h4>XXXII.  CIARAN IN ARAN (LA, LB, VG)</h4>
<p>
<i><b>The Aran Islands.</b></i>&mdash;The marvellous isles of Aran,
still a museum of all periods of ancient Irish history,
with their immense prehistoric forts and their strange
little oratories, were from an early date chosen as the
site of Christian communities. Enda ruled over a
community at the southern end of the Great Island;
the church still survives, in ruin, and bears his name.
Ciaran must have remained long enough in Aran to
make a permanent impression there, for one of the
ancient churches&mdash;much later than his time, however&mdash;is
dedicated under his invocation. The reference to
saints "known to God only" reminds us of the
dedications to saints "whose names the Lord knows"
in Greek on the font of the Church of the Nativity
at Bethlehem, and in Armenian on a mosaic pavement
at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Prophecy by Vision.</b></i>&mdash;This is not an infrequent
incident in the saints' Lives. It often appears at the
beginning of a Life, the saint's mother having a dream
interpreted by some one, whom she consults, as indicative
of the future greatness and holiness of her
unborn son. I have not hit upon another case in these<span class="page"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[page 138]</span>
documents of the same dream appearing to two persons
at once.</p>
<p>
Ciaran's visit to Enda is described at length in the
<i>Vita Endei</i> (VSH, ii, 71-2). We are there told that he
was seven years in Aran, serving faithfully in the
monastic threshing-barn, so that in the chaff-heaps it
would have been impossible to discover a single grain;
and that the walls of his threshing-barn were still
standing in Aran when the hagiographer wrote. He
then saw the vision of the tree, which, however, we are
not told was seen by Enda also. Enda interpreted the
vision as in the texts before us, and bade him go forth
to fulfil the divine will. Ciaran then went to found
Clonmacnois. He besought Enda before he departed
that he (Enda) should accept him and his <i>parochia</i> under
his protection: but Enda answered, "God hath not
ordained it so for thee, that thou shouldst in this narrow
island be under my authority. But because of thy
wondrous humility and thy perfect charity, Christ thy
Lord giveth thee a half of Ireland as thine inheritance."
Here there is another version of the claim of Clonmacnois
to legislate ecclesiastically for half of the island.
They then erected a cross as a token of their fraternal
bond, putting a curse upon whomsoever should make a
breach in their agreement. In a Life of Saint Enda,
quoted by the Bollandists (September, vol. iii, p. 376 C),
it is further averred that Enda saw in a vision all the
angels that haunted Aran departing in the company of
Ciaran as he went on his way. Distressed at this
desertion of his heavenly ministrants, he fasted and
prayed; but an angel appeared to him and comforted
him, saying that the angels were permitted to accompany
Ciaran on account of his holiness, but that they would
return again to Aran.</p><br />
<span class="page"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[page 139]</span>

<h4>XXXIII. HOW A PROPHECY WAS FULFILLED (LA, VG)</h4>
<p>
The versions of this incident differ considerably both
in detail and in the setting of the incident.</p>
<p>
"<i><b>Cluain Innsythe</b></i>," where LA sets the story, is unknown.
There is no river in Aran, where VG places the
incident; in this version, therefore, the ship is placed
on the sea.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Lonan the Left-handed.</b></i>&mdash;Nothing further is recorded
of this person, so far as I know. The parenthesis
describing how he "was ever contradictious of Ciaran"
is probably a gloss; so far as the incident goes, the
contradictiousness
is the other way.</p>
<p>
Note the interesting sidelights upon the practice of
artificially drying grain in LA. There are some technical
terms in the Latin of this incident in the LA version.
Thus, the word here translated "hut" is <i>zabulum</i>; this
I presume is another way of spelling <i>stabulum</i>, for the
meanings given in Du Cange to <i>zabulum</i> or similar words
are here quite unsuitable. The word which I have
rendered "platter" is <i>rota</i>, and the word translated
"shed" is <i>canaba</i>.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXXIV. HOW CIARAN VISITED SENAN</h4>
<p>
<i><b>Senan.</b></i>&mdash;This is an extremely interesting personality.
His island, Inis Cathaigh (now corrupted to "Scattery")
is said to derive its name from <i>Cathach</i>, a monster
(mentioned in LA) which had formerly inhabited it, and
which Senan had slain or charmed away. There are
obvious pagan elements in the legends of this saint, and
there can be little doubt that the unknown hermit who
founded the monastery, of which the remains are still to
be seen, has entered into the inheritance of the legends
of an ancient deity, most likely worshipped on the island.
This deity was probably the god of the Shannon river:<span class="page"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[page 140]</span>
and the name of the saint is clearly reminiscent of the
name of the river. In their present form the two names
are not philologically compatible: the name of the saint
may be explained as an arbitrary modification, designed
to <i>differentiate</i> the Christian saint from the pagan river-god.
That pagan names should survive (modified or
otherwise) in ancient holy places re-consecrated to
Christianity is only natural.</p>
<p>
There may be some foundation in fact for apparently
supernatural knowledge such as Senan displays in this
incident of the personality of a coming guest. In reading
documents such as this, we are not infrequently tempted
to suspect that we have before us the record of actual
manifestations of the even yet imperfectly understood
phenomena of hypnotism, telepathy, "second sight,"
and similar psychical abnormalities.</p>
<p>
The story of the cloak is told again in the Life of Senan
(LL, 2388). From the version there contained, we learn
that Ciaran gave his cloak to <i>lepers</i>. There is another
version of the visit of Ciaran to Senan in the metrical
Life of the latter saint (CS, 750). According to this story,
Ciaran was not travelling alone, but with his disciples;
and they had no means of transport to the island except
an oarless boat woven of osiers. Trusting themselves
to this doubtful craft (as Cybi voyaged in a skinless
coracle, <i>Cambro-British Saints</i>, pp. 186, 499), they were
ferried over in safety, no water finding its way into the
boat. Then follows the episode of the cloak, omitting,
however, Senan's jest of carrying it secretly. A glossator
has added in LA the marginal note "Priests formerly
wore cowls." There are slight discrepancies between
the versions as to the precise garment given by Ciaran
and restored by Senan.</p>
<p>
Another episode connecting Ciaran and Senan is
narrated in the metrical Life of Senan (though the passage<span class="page"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[page 141]</span>
is absent from the CS copy; it will be found in the
Bollandist edition, March, vol. ii, p. 766). Briefly, this
tale is to the effect that Ciaran and Brenainn went to
Senan for confession. They were received with fitting
honour, but the steward of Inis Cathaigh told his superior
that he had no provision to set before the guests. "The
Lord will provide," answered Senan; and in point of
fact, a prince for whom a feast was at the time being
prepared on the mainland was divinely inspired to send
it as a gift to the sacred island. The saints partook
of the banquet thus bestowed upon them; and while
they were doing so, a small bell fell from heaven into
their midst. None of the three was willing to assert a
claim to this gift over the other two; and after discussion
they agreed to advance in different directions, and he who
should continue longest to hear the sound of the bell was
to be its possessor. This test assigned the bell to Senan.
The shrine of this sacred relic (the bell itself is lost)
is now preserved in the museum of the Royal Irish
Academy, having been acquired from the last hereditary
keeper by a generous <a name="an20r" id="an20r"></a>donor.<a href="#an20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>
<i><b>The Geographical Names.</b></i>&mdash;Besides "the island of
Cathi" (Inis Cathaigh, Scattery) LA refers to "Luim-nich"
(Limerick), Kiarraighi (properly <i>Ciarraige</i>, [North]
Kerry), and Corco Baiscind (the southern barony of Co.
Clare), now spelt "Corcovaskin."</p>
<br />

<h4>XXXV. CIARAN IN ISEL (LA, LB, VG)</h4>
<p>
<i><b>Cobthach son of Brecan.</b></i>&mdash;This person, who is said
in VG to have made over Isel to Ciaran, was probably
a local chieftain; but he has escaped the notice of the<span class="page"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[page 142]</span>
Annalists. In any case the statement that he made
over Isel to Ciaran is so obviously incongruous with
the sense of the passage, that it can be safely rejected as
an interpolation. Its purpose is to claim for Clonmacnois
the possession of the land called Isel, the site
of which is no longer known, though it cannot have been
far from Clonmacnois. Conn of the Poor, the great and
charitable benefactor of Clonmacnois in the early years
of the eleventh century, established an almshouse at
Isel; and some fifty-six years later, in the year 1087,
his son Cormac, then abbot, purchased Isel in perpetuity
from the king of Meath.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Parallels.</b></i>&mdash;We have already (incident XXI) seen an
example of the rescue of a book from rain; compare also
incident XLI. The garment of Finan (CS, 316) and of
Cainnech (CS, 371) were preserved from rain, and snow
did not injure a book belonging to Abban (CS, 530).
The forgetfulness attributed to the saint with regard to
his precious volume is a regular feature of this type of
incident: it is no doubt meant to honour him, as indicating
that the fulfilment of his monastic duties were yet
more precious in his eyes. Moling forgot his book when
reading by the sea-shore, and though the tide arose and
covered it, it remained uninjured (VSH, ii, 191). There
are numerous illustrations of the paramount need of
attending to guests scattered through the saints' Lives.</p>
<p>
The story of the grain cast into the breast of a poor
man has come down to us in confusion: it is not clear
why the chariot is introduced at all. Probably we have a
conflation of two incidents. In the one (which is the
version followed by LA, for which see § 26 of that document)
Ciaran gave to a pauper a chariot and horses
which the prince Oengus son of Cremthann had given him:
as that prince belongs to the boyhood stories, it is
probable that this incident should be transferred to that<span class="page"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[page 143]</span>
section of the Life. In the other incident, which may
belong to the Isel period, Ciaran flings grain into the
breast of the poor man, where it turns into gold: and
we may suppose that the pointless re-transformation of
the gold to grain did not take place. A similar tale is
told of Saint Aed (VSH, ii, 308). The weird story of
the jester who stopped the funeral of Guaire, king of
Connacht, famous for his abounding liberality, and
demanded a gift of the dead man, is of the same type;
we are told that the dead king scooped up some earth
with his hand, and flung it into the jester's lap, where
it became pure <a name="an21r" id="an21r"></a>gold.<a href="#an21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<br />

<h4>XXXVI. THE REMOVAL OF THE LAKE (LA, LB, VG)</h4>
<p>
The island in the lake was probably a crannog, or
artificial fortified island, such as are common on the
lakes of Ireland. Fundamentally the story is an evident
aetiological myth, intended to account for the existence
of some curious swampy hollow. In its present form it
is obviously suggested by Matt, xvii, 20. Note that VG
does not seem to contemplate the wholesale removal of
the lake.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Parallels</b></i> are not wanting. Findian dried up a lake by
prayer (CS, 192); and houses were shifted from the west
side to the east side of a flood for the convenience of
Colum Cille (LL, 858). Saint Cainnech, finding the
excessive singing of birds on a certain island to be an
interruption to his devotions, compelled them to keep
silence (CS, 376; VSH, i, 161).</p><br />

<span class="page"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[page 144]</span>
<h4>XXXVII. CIARAN DEPARTS FROM ISEL (LA, VG)</h4>
<p>
<i><b>Parallels.</b></i>&mdash;The nuns of Brigit made a similar complaint
against the excessive charity of their abbess (LL, 1598).
For the stag compare incident XXI; also the tale of how
Brenainn was on one occasion guided by a hound (CS,
116). Ruadan, having given in alms his chariot-horses
to lepers, found two stags to take their place (CS, 328).</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Stanza in VG.</b></i>&mdash;The metre is one of the numerous
forms of <i>debide</i>, seven-syllable lines with echo-rhymes
in which the rhyme-syllable is stressed in the first line,
unstressed in the second (as <i>mén</i>, <i>táken</i>). The stanza
before us is in <i>debide scáilte</i>, where the two couplets of
the stanza are not linked by any form of sound assonance.
The literal translation is: "Although it be low it would
have been high / had not the murmuring come // the
murmuring, had it not come / it would have been high
though it be low."</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Geographical Names in LA.</b></i>&mdash;Loch Rii (properly
Loch Rib) is Loch Ree on the Shannon, above Athlone.
The island called Inis Aingin has now the name of
Hare Island; it is at the south end of the lake near the
outlet of the river. There are some scanty remains of a
monastic establishment to be seen upon it.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXXVIII. CIARAN IN INIS AINGIN (LA, LB, VG)</h4>
<p>
<i><b>The Presbyter Daniel.</b></i>&mdash;For the presence here of a
Welsh or British priest, see the remarks in Plummer,
VSH, i, p. cxxiv. But it is probable that in the original
form of the story the presbyter Daniel was a fictitious
ecclesiastic, perhaps the Evil One disguised. We may
compare the two false bishops that came to expel Colum
Cille from Iona (LL, 1007). Biblical names were sometimes
used in the early Irish Church, though native names
were preferred. There is actually the monument of a <span class="page"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[page 145]</span>
person called Daniel at Clonmacnois; it is a slab, bearing
an engraved cross and inscription, probably of the ninth
or tenth century.</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Gift.</b></i>&mdash;This is said in VG to have been a cup
adorned with birds. Such forms of decoration seem to
have been common, and are sometimes referred to in
Irish romances, though few, if any, examples that may be
compared with the descriptions have come down to us.
In LA a word <i>antilum</i> is used, which does not appear to
occur anywhere else, and is unknown to our lexicographers.
It is possibly a corruption for <i>an(n)ulum</i>, "a
ring." Naturally this tale of the gift must be a later
accretion to the story, if it had the origin just suggested.</p>
<p>
Note, in the long eulogy of the saint which the author
of LB gives us here, that the writer has not hesitated to
introduce reminiscences of Phil, ii, 7, 8, thus hinting at
the general <i>Tendenz</i> of the Lives of Saint Ciaran. The
rest of the eulogy is a free paraphrase of Rom. xii, 9 ff.
There is extant a metrical "Monastic Rule" attributed
to Saint Ciaran, which was edited by the late Prof.
Strachan in <i>Eriu</i> (The journal of the Dublin "School of
Irish Learning") vol. ii, p. 227. The subject-matter of
this composition is a series of regulations on morality
and mortification of the flesh, but the language is so
obscure, and the text of the single MS. which alone
contains it is so corrupt, that even the pre-eminent
Celtist who edited the poem would not venture on a
translation.</p>
<br />

<h4>XXXIX. THE COMING OF OENNA (LA, LB, VG)</h4>
<p>
<i><b>Parallels.</b></i>&mdash;As Ciaran recognised Oenna by his voice,
so Colman picked out by his voice one of a number of
soldiers destined for a religious life (VSH, i, 261). With
the incident of the consecration, as successor, of an unprepossessing<span class="page"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[page 146]</span>
intruder, compare the tale of Findian consecrating
for the same purpose a raider whom he caught hiding
in the furnace-chamber of his kiln (LL, 2628 ff.; CS, 198).
The version in LB conveys the impression that Oenna's
learning was imparted to him miraculously, as Oengus
the Culdee inspired an idle boy with a miraculous
knowledge of his neglected <a name="an22r" id="an22r"></a>lesson.<a href="#an22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>
The story of Oenna is told rather differently in the
glosses to the <i>Martyrology of Oengus</i> (Bradshaw edn.,
pp. 48 ff.). Oenna with two companions was going for
military service to the King of Connacht. They came to
the embarking-place, not of Inis Aingin, but the larger
Inis Clothrann (now sometimes called Quaker Island),
where there are extensive ancient monastic remains.
Ciaran was at the time in Inis Clothrann. He summoned
Oenna to him, and asked him whither he was faring.
"To the King of Connacht," answered Oenna. "Were
it not better rather to contract with the King of Heaven
and earth?" asked Ciaran. "It were better," said
Oenna, "if it be right to do so." "It is right," answered
Ciaran. Then Oenna was tonsured and began his
studies. Here the miraculous insight which recognised
in the warrior youth the future abbot is ignored. The
tract <i>De <a name="an23r" id="an23r"></a>Arreis</i><a href="#an23"><sup>23</sup></a> tells us of the penance which Ciaran
imposed upon Oenna: briefly stated it was as follows.
He was to remain three days and three nights in a darkened
room, not breaking his fast save with three sips of
water each day. Every day he was to sing the whole
Psalter, standing, without a staff to support him, making
a genuflexion at the end of each Psalm, reciting <i>Beati</i>
after each fifty, and <i>Hymnum dicat</i> after every <i>Beati</i> in
cross-vigil (<i>i.e.</i>, standing upright with his arms stretched
out sideways horizontally). He was not to lie down but<span class="page"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[page 147]</span>
only to sit, was to observe the canonical hours, and was
to meditate on the Passion of Christ and upon his own
sins.</p>
<p>
The author of LA betrays his Irish personality by a
phrase which he uses of Oenna. Ciaran bids his followers
to fetch <i>materiam abbatis uestri</i>&mdash;"the makings of your
abbot." This is a regular idiom for an heir-apparent,
and it shows that if the writer be not actually translating
from an Irish document, he is at least thinking in Irish
as he writes in Latin.</p>
<br />

<h4>XL. HOW CIARAN RECOVERED HIS GOSPEL (LA, VG)</h4>
<p>
There is another story of a gospel recovered from a
lake, but without any mention of a cow as the agent for
its rescue (CS, 556). The tale may be founded on fact.
The "Port of the Gospel" is now forgotten.</p>
<p>
Books preserved as relics (<i>e.g.</i> the gospels belonging
to a sainted founder) were kept in metal shrines, and
valuable books which were in use were hung in satchels
of leather on the walls of the library or scriptorium.
Two specimens of such satchels still remain.</p>
<br />

<h4>XLI. HOW CIARAN WENT FROM INIS AINGHIN TO
CLONMACNOIS (LA, LB, VG)</h4>
<p>
<i><b>Parallels.</b></i>&mdash;As Ciaran gave up his monastery to Donnan,
in like manner Munnu surrendered his settlement to the
virgin Emer (CS, 495). The list of equipments delivered
by Ciaran to Donnan introduces us to the "human
beast of burden," Mael-Odran, a servile functionary
occasionally met with in Irish literature. A well-known
incident of St. Adamnan introduces him travelling
"with his mother on his back" (see Reeves, <i>Vita</i><span class="page"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[page 148]</span>
<i>Columbae</i>, p. 179). As to the bell, it may be worth
noting that my friend Mr. Walter Campbell, formerly
of Athlone, has informed me that an ancient bronze
ecclesiastical bell, found on the lake shore opposite Hare
Island, was long preserved, and used as a domestic bell,
in the cottage of a man named Quigley. The owner
believed that it was the bell of St. Ciaran, possibly that
mentioned in VG: this is not impossible, though hardly
likely, as a bell of such antiquity would most probably
be of iron, and rendered useless by corrosion. Unfortunately,
the bell in question is no longer forthcoming: it
disappeared one day from Quigley's house, stolen, he
believed, by a tourist who chanced to pass by.</p>
<p>
Note Donnan's relationship to Senan as set forth in
VG. He was brother's-son of Senan, but had the same
mother as Senan. Clearly this indicates a <i>ménage</i> such
as that indicated by Cæsar as existing among the wilder
tribes of Britain; a polyandry in which the husbands
were father and sons (<i>De Bello Gallico</i>, V, xiv). These
people were probably pre-Celtic, and this strengthens
the arguments already put forward for a pre-Celtic
origin for the Protagonist of our narrative.</p>
<p>
On the subject of the burial of the chieftains of Ui
Neill and the Connachta at Clonmacnois, see Plummer,
i, p. cx. Neill is the genitive of Niall.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Ard Manntain</b></i> is now unknown.</p>
<p>
The chronological indications contained in VG are
sufficiently close to accuracy to show that they have been
calculated, though the computor has made a miscount
of a year. The eighth of the calends of February (25th
January) in A.D. 548 was actually a Saturday, but it
was two days before new moon. The same day in A.D.
549 was the tenth day of the moon, but it fell on a
Monday.</p>
<p>
Of the companions of Ciaran, Oengus (properly Oenna)<span class="page"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[page 149]</span>
succeeded him as abbot, dying in A.D. 569; Mac Nisse,
who was an Ultonian, followed him, and died 13 June
584 (aliter 587). The others, however, do not appear to
have found a place in the martyrologies. Mo-Beoc is
a different person from the famous Mo-Beog of Loch
Derg in Co. Donegal.</p>
<br />

<h4>XLII. THE FOUNDATION OF THE CHURCH (LA, VG)</h4>
<p>
The two versions are independent. But though there
are no wizards or druids in the VG version, they
appear in another story connecting Diarmait with the
foundation of Clonmacnois. This is to the effect that
Diarmait was at a place on the Shannon near Clonmacnois,
called Snam dá Én, and saw the glow of the
first camp-fire lighted on the site of the future
monastery by Ciaran and his followers. The druids
who were with Diarmait told him that unless that fire
were forthwith quenched, it would never be put out.
"It shall be quenched immediately," said Diarmait;
so with hostile purpose he advanced on Clonmacnois,
but instead of doing what he proposed, he suffered
himself to be pressed into the service of the builders,
as the story in VG narrates. The tale in LA is interesting,
as showing (1) the existence of a calendar
of seasons lucky and unlucky for various enterprises,
and (2) a spirit of kindly tolerance on the part of the
pagan wizard.</p>
<p>
The wiles of wizards were exposed by various saints,
<i>e.g.</i> by Aed and by Cainnech. These tales are curious;
the wizard in each case appeared to pass through a
tree, but the saint opened the eyes of the spectators,
so that they saw him actually passing round it (CS,
353, 368; VSH, i, 156). This reads like the exposure of<span class="page"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[page 150]</span>
hypnotically induced <a name="an24r" id="an24r"></a>hallucinations.<a href="#an24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>
Diarmait mac Cerrbeil, or more properly mac Fergusa
Cerrbeil, was grandson of Conall Cremthainne, son of
Niall Noi-giallach, the ancestor of the royal line
of Ui Neill. The reigning king, Tuathal Moel-Garb, of
whom we have already heard, was grandson of Coirpre,
another son of Niall. As a possible rival for the kingship,
Tuathal had driven him into banishment. Mael-Moire,
or Mael-Morda, who murdered Tuathal, was
Diarmait's foster-brother. When Diarmait was installed
on the throne, he summoned the convention of Uisnech&mdash;one
of the places where from time immemorial religious
Pan-Iernean assemblies, resembling in character the
Pan-Hellenic Olympic gatherings, had been held. How
Diarmait afterwards offended Ciaran, was cursed by
him, and met his death in consequence of that curse,
may be read in the tale printed in <i>Silua Gadelica</i>, No. vi,
from which we have just quoted the version of the
story of setting up of the corner-post.</p>
<p>
There are chronological discrepancies, difficult if not
impossible to reconcile, between the annalist's dates for
Diarmait and those for Ciaran. The <i>Annals of Ulster</i>
places the death of Tuathal in 543, the accession of Diarmait
in 544, and the death of Ciaran in 548, seven years
after founding Clonmacnois. Some MSS. of these Annals,
however, omit the reference to the seven years, and place
the accession of Diarmait in 548, evidently to reconcile
the stories. According to the <i>Annals of the Four Masters</i>,
Tuathal was slain in 538, Diarmait succeeded in 539, and
Ciaran died in 548. The <i>Annals of Clonmacnois</i> is more
consonant with the chronology of the Life of Ciaran. It<span class="page"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[page 151]</span>
tells the tale so picturesquely that we transcribe it here,
as before modernising the spelling&mdash;</p>
<p>
"<b>535.</b> Tuathal Moel-Garb began his reign, and reigned
eleven years&hellip;. He caused Diarmait mac Cerrbeil to
live in exile and in desert places, because he claimed to
have right to the crown&hellip;.</p>
<p>
"<b>547.</b> King Tuathal having proclaimed throughout
the whole kingdom the banishment of Diarmait mac
Cerrbeil, as before is specified, with a great reward to
him that would bring him his heart, the said Diarmait
for fear of his life lived in the deserts of Clonmacnois,
then called Ard Tiprat: and meeting with the abbot
Saint Ciaran, in the place where the church of Clonmacnois
now stands, who was but newly come thither to
live or dwell from Inis Aingin, and having no house or
place to reside or dwell in, the said Diarmait gave him
his assistance to make a house there, and in thrusting
down in the earth one of the pieces of the timber or
wattles of the house, the said Diarmait took Saint Ciaran's
hand and did put it over his own head or hand in sign
of reverence to the saint: whereupon the saint humbly
besought God of His great goodness that by that time
to-morrow ensuing that [<i>sic</i>] the hands of Diarmait might
have superiority over all Ireland. Which fell out as the
saint requested, for Mael-Moire ó hArgata, foster-brother
of Diarmait, seeing in what perplexity the nobleman was
in [<i>sic</i>], besought him that he might be pleased to lend
him his black horse, and that he would make his repair
to Greallach da Phuill, where he heard King Tuathal to
have a meeting with some of his nobles; and there would
present him with a whelp's heart on a spear's head,
instead of Diarmait's heart, and so by that means get
access to the king, whom he would kill out of hand and
by the help and swiftness of the horse save his own life
whether they would or no. Diarmait, listing to the<span class="page"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[page 152]</span>
words of his foster-brother was amongst two extremities,
loath to refuse him and far more loath to lend it him,
fearing he should miscarry and be killed, but between
both, he granted him his request; whereupon he prepared
himself, and went as he was resolved, mounted on
the said black horse, a heart besprinkled with blood on
his spear, to the place where he heard the king to be;
the king and his people seeing him come in that manner,
supposed that it was Diarmait's heart that was to be
presented by the man that rode in post-haste; the whole
multitude gave him way to that king, and when he came
within reach to the king as though to tender him the
heart, he gave the king such a deadly blow of his spear
that the king instantly fell down dead in the midst of his
people, whereupon the man was beset on all sides and at
last taken and killed, so as speedy news came to Diarmait,
who incontinently went to Tara, and there was crowned
king as Saint Ciaran prayed and prophesied before&hellip;.
Diarmait was not above seven months king, when Saint
Ciaran died in Clonmacnois, where he dwelt therein
but seven months before, in the thirty-third year of
his age, on the 9th of September."</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Stanzas in VG.</b></i>&mdash;The metre is <i>ae freslige</i>. Literally:
"I shall speak witness truly / though single is thy
numerous train // thou shalt be a king pleasant, dignified /
of Ireland this time to-morrow /// The slaying of chosen
Tuathal / Moel-Garb, it was a crying without glory //
thence is the choice saying / 'it was the deed of Moel-Moire'
/// Without rout and without slaughter / he
took Uisnech, it was not after an assembly // Diarmait
the eminent gave / a hundred churches to God and to
Ciaran."</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Episode of Tren</b></i> (VG).&mdash;This story illustrates
a belief in sympathetic magic. What Tren had done to
deserve this punishment is unknown, nor is the site of<span class="page"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[page 153]</span>
Cluain Iochtar identified. Possibly he had endeavoured
to prevent Ciaran from founding his church; compare
the story of Findian and Baeth (LL, 2624). Patrick
had a dispute with a certain Trian, but the details of the
story are different (TT, p. 45, ch. lxxx, etc.). It is
difficult for us to put ourselves into the position of people
who thought to honour their saint by telling a story about
him which we should consider not only silly but immoral.
But such an attempt must be tried if we are to understand
anything of ancient writings, in whatever language
and from whatever countries they may come down to
us. Even when we read so modern and so universal
an author as Shakspere we must for the moment imagine
ourselves sixteenth-century Elizabethans; the more we
succeed in doing so, the better do we understand what
we read. So, in criticising a story like this, we must
rid ourselves of all our twentieth-century prejudices,
and accept it in the simple faith of those to whom it was
intended to be told.</p>
<p>
On one of the great carved crosses still to be seen in
Clonmacnois&mdash;that erected in memory of Flann King of
Ireland (ob. 914)&mdash;there is a panel representing an ecclesiastic
and a layman holding an upright post between
them. It has been plausibly conjectured that this
represents the erection of the corner-post of the church, as
described in our text.</p>
<br />

<h4>XLIII. HOW CIARAN SENT A CLOAK TO SENAN (LA, VG)</h4>
<p>
The "Cloak of Senan" must have been an actual
relic preserved on Inis Cathaig; tradition said that it
had been floated on the river to the saint of the island,
though there were various opinions as to which saint
had done the miracle; it is attributed to Brigit daughter
of Cu Cathrach (LL, 2399) and to Diarmait (CS, 753).<span class="page"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[page 154]</span>
For parallels to the automatic transfer of objects by
water, see Plummer, VSH, i, p. clxxxvi, note 2.</p>
<br />

<h4>XLIV. CIARAN AND THE WINE (LA, LB, VG)</h4>
<p>
The choice laid before the monks is curious, and hardly
consonant with the usual spirit of abjuring the world; it
may be aetiological, designed to explain, and perhaps to
excuse, the opulence and temporal importance of Clonmacnois
at the time when it was written. A similar
but not identical story appears in the life of Munnu
(VSH, ii, 227).</p>
<p>
It is quite obvious that the story as we have it is a
conflation of two versions of the anecdote. In the one
version the wine was brought by Frankish merchants
and acquired by purchase; in the other it was provided
by miracle. The composite story appears in LA and
VG; LB knows the miraculous version only.</p>
<p>
That Frankish merchants should have sailed up the
Shannon and delivered a cargo of wine at a settlement
in the heart of Ireland in the middle of the sixth century,
is no mere extravagance. The subject of ancient Irish
trade has been very fully investigated by the late Prof.
Zimmer, and he has brought a large number of facts
together which show that such an episode is a quite
credible fragment of <a name="an25r" id="an25r"></a>history.<a href="#an25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>
The second version, though LB calls it <i>miraculum
insolitum</i>, is one of the commonplaces of hagiography.
Water was turned to wine by a host of saints, such as
Colum Cille (LL, 839), Fursa (CS, 111), Findian (CS, 205),
Lugaid (CS, 283), Aed (CS, 339), and others needless<span class="page"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[page 155]</span>
to specify. Fintan (CS, 404), and Munnu (CS, 503),
blessed a cup in such wise that one of their followers,
while appearing, in self-abnegation, to drink nothing
but water for thirty years, was in reality enjoying the
best wine! Saint Brynach drew wine from a brook and
fishes from its stones (<i>Cambro-British Saints</i>, pp. 12, 298),
Brigit (LL, 1241) and Colman Elo (CS, 441) turned water
into ale; the former (LL, 1368) as well as Lugaid (CS,
269, 280) and Fintan (CS, 404) turned water into milk.</p>
<p>
I have not found any exact parallel to the incident of
the scented thumb.</p>
<p>
There is a cognate tale in the Life of Colman, in which
monks, thirsty with labour, expressed a doubt as to the
reality of the heavenly reward, whereupon their eyes
were opened to see a vision of the joys of the after-life
(VSH, i, 265).</p>
<p>
The <i>Tendenz</i> of the biographies of Ciaran is clearly
marked in the hint at a parallel between the last supper
of Ciaran and the Last Passover of Our Lord.</p>
<br />

<h4>XLV. THE STORY OF CRITHIR (LA, VG)</h4>
<p>
On the consecrated Paschal fire, see Frazer, <i>Balder the
Beautiful</i>, vol. i, p. 120 ff.</p>
<p>
<i><b>Parallels.</b></i>&mdash;Coemgen carried fire in his bosom (CS, 837,
VSH, i, 236). Cadoc also carried fire in his cloak without
injury (<i>Cambro-British Saints</i>, pp. 30, 319). Elsewhere
we hear of flames which do not consume, as in the burning
bush of Moses, and probably in imitation of it (Exod.
iii, 2). Thus the magic fire that delivered Samthann
from a forced marriage appeared to ignite a whole town,
which, however, suffered no injury (VSH, ii, 253). The
fall of fire from heaven in answer to prayer is most likely
imitated from 1 Kings xviii, 38.</p>
<p>
The verse extracts at the end of LB (which see) contain <span class="page"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[page 156]</span>
a form of this story incompatible with the prose narratives.</p>
<p>
The boy slain but not torn by wolves is, of course,
imitated from the Prophet whose story is told in 1 Kings
xiii, which is directly quoted in LA.</p>
<p>
The mutual blessings of the two saints may be compared
with the prophecy said to have been uttered by
Ciaran of Saints Cronan and Molan who visited him at
Clonmacnois (CS, 542). The one (Cronan) took away
with him the remains of his repast for distribution to the
poor, the other left them behind in the monastery; whereupon
Ciaran said that the monastery of the one should
be rich in wealth and in charity, that of the other should
always maintain the rule (of poverty). Such tales as
this, of compacts between saints, are probably based on
mutual arrangements of one kind or another between the
monasteries which claimed the saints as founders; we
have already seen leagues established between Clonard
and Aran on one side and Clonmacnois on the other,
expressed as leagues made by Ciaran with Findian and
Enda respectively. Contrariwise, we read of the disagreement
of saints when their monasteries were at feud with
one another. Ciaran was not always so successful in
making treaties with his ecclesiastical brethren. Thus,
he is said to have made overtures to Colman mac Luachain
of Lann (now Lynn, Co. Westmeath)&mdash;a remarkable
feat in itself, as Colman died about a century after his
time&mdash;but not only did Colman refuse, but he sent a
swarm of demons in the shape of wasps to repel Ciaran
and his followers, who were journeying towards him.
Ciaran then made a more moderate offer, which Colman
again <a name="an26r" id="an26r"></a>refused.<a href="#an26"><sup>26</sup></a> Lann was in the territory of the Delbna,
who, although friendly to Clonmacnois in the middle of<span class="page"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[page 157]</span>
the eleventh century, plundered it towards its close
(<i>Chronicon Scotorum</i>, 1058, 1090; <i>Annals of Four Masters</i>,
1060).</p>
<p>
The chronology of Ciaran the Elder is entirely uncertain.
He is said to have been one of the pre-Patrician
saints, in which case he could hardly have been a contemporary
of Ciaran the Younger, unless we believe in the
portentous length of life with which the hagiographers
credit him (over three centuries, according to the <i>Martyrology
of Donegal</i>, though others are content with a
more moderate estimate).</p>
<p>
The story of Crithir is told again in the Lives of Ciaran
the Elder (see <i>Silua Gadelica</i>, vol. i, p. 14, and corresponding
translation). The culprit is there called Crithid, and
the version adds that the event took place in a time of
snow.</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Geographical Names in LA.</b></i>&mdash;Saigyr, properly
Saigir, is now Seir-Kieran in King's Co. Hele, properly
Eile, was a region comprising the baronies of Clonlisk
and Ballybrit in King's Co., and Eliogarty and Ikerrin
in Tipperary.</p>
<br />

<h4>XLVI. HOW AN INSULT TO CIARAN WAS AVERTED (LB)</h4>
<p>
For parallels to this story see Plummer, VSH, i, p.
clxxxvii, note. Compare also the third of the metrical
fragments with which LB closes. It is clear that the
purpose of the robbers was to efface the tonsure of the
saint; very likely ecclesiastics were on occasion subjected
to such rough treatment during the period of transition
between Paganism and Christianity.</p><br />

<span class="page"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[page 158]</span>

<h4>XLVII. HOW CIARAN WAS SAVED FROM SHAME (LB)</h4>
<p>
Contemporary representations (<i>e.g.</i> on the sculptured
crosses) show that at this time two garments were normally
worn, a <i>lene</i> or inner tunic, and a <i>bratt</i> or mantle.
These, with the addition of a cape, something like a
university hood, which could be thrown over the head,
made up the complete equipment, and if all these were
given to beggars the owner would be left completely
destitute. So, in the story of the Battle of Carn Conaill,
as narrated in the <i>Book of the Dun Cow</i>, Guaire, king of
Connacht, of whom we have already heard, on one
occasion would, if permitted, have divested himself of all
clothing to satisfy importunate beggars. The device of
the water-covering is remarkable.</p>
<br />

<h4>XLVIII. HOW A MAN WAS SAVED FROM ROBBERS (LB)</h4>
<p>
This story, summarily and rather obscurely told in
the text before us, is related more clearly in the Life of
Brenainn (VSH, i, 101). The saint, seeing a man hard
pressed by his enemies, bade him take up his position
beside a standing stone; he then transformed the victim
into the stone, and the stone into the victim. The
assailants, thus deceived, cut off the head of the stone,
and departed in triumph: the saint then reversed the
transformation, leaving the man to go his way in peace.
An analogous story is that of Cadoc, who turned raided
cattle into bundles of fern, and transformed them back
to cattle when the raiders had retired discomfited (<i>Cambro-British
Saints</i>, pp. 49, 342).</p>
<br />

<h4>XLIX. THE DEATH OF CIARAN (LA, LB, VG)</h4>
<p>
This impressive story, which is as remote as possible
in style from the ordinary stock incident, is probably
authentic. The chronological indications in VG are <span class="page"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[page 159]</span>
quite wrong: the 9th of September A.D. 548 was a
Wednesday, and was the twentieth day of the moon.
They are, however, so far accurate for the year 556,
that 9th September in that year was Saturday, and was
the <i>nineteenth</i> day of the moon. As the observation of
new moon, if not astronomically calculated, is often
wrong by a day, owing to the faint crescent not being
seen at its very first appearance, this is sufficiently
close to allow us to enquire legitimately whether 556
may not have been the true date of Ciaran's death.</p>
<p>
The Bollandists cite from the Life of Saint Cellach a
tale to the effect that Cellach was son of Eogan Bel
King of Connacht, and was a monk at Clonmacnois;
but on the death of his father he secretly absconded, in
order to secure the kingdom for himself. Becoming
convinced of the sinfulness of this proceeding, he returned
and submitted to Ciaran once more, who received him
fraternally <i>after he had spent a year in penance</i>. As the
Bollandists point out, this story (quite independently
of its historical authenticity) reveals a tradition other
than that of Ciaran spending but seven months on earth
after founding Clonmacnois. The <i>Annals of Ulster</i>
also gives him a longer time at Clonmacnois, dating the
foundation 541, and the death of the saint 548: a
space of seven years. This would make the saint only
twenty-six years old when he founded Clonmacnois,
which is perhaps improbable. We may suggest another
way of reconciling the traditions, taking the orthodox
date for the foundation of Clonmacnois (548) but postponing
the death of the saint to 556, in accordance with
the astronomical indications. Some one noticed that
if his life were retrenched to the year of the foundation
of the monastery, it would be brought into conformity
in length with the Life of Christ.</p>
<p>
With Ciaran's indifference as to the fate of his relics,<span class="page"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[page 160]</span>
contrast the dying injunction of Cuthbert to his monks,
that they should dig up his bones and transport them
whithersoever they should <a name="an27r" id="an27r"></a>go.<a href="#an27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>
The <i><b>Little Church</b></i> intended by the author is presumably
the small chapel, of which the ruins still remain at Clonmacnois,
called Saint Ciaran's chapel. It is a century or
two later than Ciaran's time, but may very probably
stand on the site of Ciaran's wooden church. Hard by
is the end of a raised causeway leading to the Nunnery;
this may be the "Little Height" referred to.</p>
<br />

<h4>L. THE VISIT OF COEMGEN (LA, VG)</h4>
<p>
Coemgen's petulance at the preoccupation of the
bereaved monks (VG) is in keeping with other traditions
of that peppery saint. The resurrection of Ciaran after
three days is another touch in imitation of the Gospel
story: it is, however, also told of Saint Darerca, who
appeared to her nuns three days after her death
(CS, 185).</p>
<p>
The story before us is thus related in the Life of
Coemgen: "At another time most blessed Coemgenus
made his way to visit most holy Kyaranus the abbot,
who founded his settlement Cluayn meic Noys, which is
in the western border of the territory of Meath, on the
bank of the river Synna over against the province of
the Connachta. But Saint Cyaranus on the third day
before Saint Coemgenus arrived, passed from this world
to Christ. His body was laid in a church on a bier, till
Saint Coemgenus and other saints should come to bury
him. And Saint Coemgenus coming late to the monastery
of Saint Chyaranus, he entered the church in which
was the holy body and commanded all the brethren to
go forth, wishing to spend that night alone beside the<span class="page"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[page 161]</span>
sacred body. And when all the brethren had gone out,
Saint Coemgenus carefully closed the door of the church,
and remained there alone till the following day; but
some of the brethren were watching till morning before
the doors of the church. And as Saint Coemgenus prayed
there, the most blessed soul of Saint Chiaranus returned
to his body, and he rose and began to speak in health-giving
words to Saint Coemgenus. The brethren remaining
outside heard the voice of each of them clearly. Saint
Kyaranus asked blessed Coemgenus that they should
interchange their vesture, as a sign of everlasting fellowship:
and so they did. On the following day when
the door of the church was opened, the brethren found
Saint Coemgenus clad in the vesture of Saint Kyaranus,
and Kyaranus wrapped in the vestments of Saint Coemgenus.
The body of Saint Kyaranus was warm, having
a ruddy tinge in the face. Saint Coemgenus pointed out
to the monks of Saint Kyaranus the brotherhood and
fellowship which he and Saint Kyaranus had established
for ever between themselves and their places and their
monks; and the brethren who watched that night bore
testimony thereto. When the body of Saint Kyaranus
was honourably committed to the ground, Saint Coemgenus
returned to his own settlement." (VSH, i, 248).</p>
<p>
In this story we see as before the explanation of a
treaty between Clonmacnois and Glendaloch.</p>
<p>
The <i><b>Annals of Clonmacnois</b></i> narrates the story of the
death of Ciaran and the visit of Coemgen, with an interesting
additional miracle. "Dying, he desired his monks
that they would bury his body in the Little Church of
Clonmacnois, and stop the door thereof with stones, and
let nobody have access thereunto until his companion
Coemgen had come; which they accordingly did. But
Saint Coemgen dwelling at Glendaloch in Leinster then, it
was revealed to him of the death of his dear and loving<span class="page"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[page 162]</span>
companion Saint Ciaran, whereupon he came suddenly to
Clonmacnois: and finding the monks and servants of
Saint Ciaran in their sorrowful and sad dumps after the
death of their said lord and master, he asked them of
the cause of their sadness. They were so heartless for
grief as they gave no answer; and at last, fearing he
would grow angry, they told him Saint Ciaran was dead
and buried, and ordered or ordained the place of his
burial should be kept without access until his coming.
The stones being taken out of the door, Saint Coemgen
entered, to whom Saint Ciaran appeared: and [they]
remained conversing together for twenty-four hours,
as is very confidently laid down in the Life of Saint
Ciaran; and afterwards Saint Coemgen departed to the
place of his own abiding, [and] left Saint Ciaran buried
in the said Little Church of Clonmacnois. But king
Diarmait most of all men grieved for his death, insomuch
that he grew deaf, and could not hear the causes of his
subjects, by reason of the heaviness and troublesomeness
of his brains. Saint Colum Cille being then banished
into Scotland, king Diarmait made his repair to him,
to the end [that] he might work some means by miracles
for the recovery of his health and hearing: and withal
told Saint Colum Cille how he assembled all the physicians
of Ireland, and that they could not help him. Then
said Saint Colum: 'Mine advice unto you is to make
your repair to Clonmacnois, to the place where your
ghostly father and friend Saint Ciaran is buried: and
there to put a little of the earth of his grave or of himself
in your ears, which is the medicine which I think to be
most available to help you.' The king having received
the said instructions of Saint Colum, took his journey
immediately to Clonmacnois; and finding Oenna maccu
Laigsi, who was abbot of the place after Saint Ciaran,
absent, he spoke to Lugaid, then parish priest of Clonmacnois,<span class="page"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[page 163]</span>
and told him of Saint Colum's instructions unto
him. Whereupon priest Lugaid and king Diarmait
fasted and watched that night in the Little Church where
Saint Ciaran was buried, and the next morning the priest
took the bell that he had, named then the White <a name="an28r" id="an28r"></a>Bell,<a href="#an28"><sup>28</sup></a>
and mingled part of the clay of Saint Ciaran therein with
holy water, and put the same in the king's ears, and immediately
the king had as good hearing as any in the
kingdom, and the whole sickness and troubles of his
brains ceased at that instant, which made the king to
say, <i>Is feartach an ní do ní an clog orainn</i>, which is as much
as to say in English, 'The bell did do us a miraculous
turn.' Which bell Saint Lugna conveyed with him to
the church of Fore, where he remained afterwards.
King Diarmait bestowed great gifts of lands on Clonmacnois
in honour of Saint Ciaran, for the recovery of
his health."</p>
<p>
The bell, called the <i>bóbán</i> of Coemgen, reappears much
later in history as a relic on which oaths were taken
(<i>Annals of Clonmacnois</i>, anno 1139; <i>Four Masters</i>, anno
1143). It was doubtless a relic preserved at Glendaloch,
in which the people of Clonmacnois rightly or wrongly
claimed a part-proprietorship. The name is obscure:
it means, according to O'Davoren's Glossary, a calf or
little cow: and Plummer (VSH, i, p. clxxvii) suggests
that this name may be an allusion to its small size. But
why "calf"? Is it an allusion to the original use of
the type of bells used for ecclesiastical purposes in
Ireland, as cow-bells?</p>

Angels were seen by Saint Colman to fill the space
between heaven and earth to receive the soul of Pope
Gregory (VSH, i, 264).</p><br />

<h4>LI. THE EARTH OF CIARAN'S TOMB DELIVERS COLUM
CILLE FROM A WHIRLPOOL (LA, LB)</h4>
<p>
This is perhaps an imitation of the tale of the Empress
Helena, who, when returning after her discovery of the
True Cross, was delivered from a storm by casting one
of the Nails into the sea. Colum Cille was saved from
the whirlpool of Coire Bhreacain (Corrievreckan, between
Jura and Scarba) on another (?) occasion, by reciting
a hymn to Brigit (LL, 1706).</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Visit of Colum Cille to Clonmacnois.</b></i>&mdash;This took
place during the rule of Ailithir, the fourth abbot of
Clonmacnois (A.D. 589-595). It is described in Adamnan's
<i>Vita Columbae</i>, where we read of the honour paid to
the distinguished visitor, and how he was greeted with
hymns and praises, while a canopy was borne over him
on his way to the church, to protect him from inconvenient
crowding. A humble boy, a useless servitor in
the monastery, came behind Columba to touch the hem
of his garment: the saint, miraculously apprised of this,
caught him by the neck and held him, despite the protests
of the brethren that he should dismiss this "wretched
and noxious boy." Then he bade the boy stretch forth
his tongue, and blessed it, prophesying his future increase
in wisdom and knowledge, and his eminence as a preacher.
The boy was Ernin or Ernoc, the patron saint of Kilmarnock;
and Adamnan had the tale from Failbe, who
was standing by as Ernin himself related the incident to
Abbot Segine of Í. Colum Cille also prophesied the Easter
controversy, and told of angelic visitations that he had
had within the precincts of Clonmacnois: but Adamnan
says nothing about the hymn to Ciaran, or the wonder-working
clay from his tomb, although elsewhere in his
book the terrors of Corrievreckan are alluded to. According
to a prophecy of Colum Cille narrated in O'Donnell's
Life of that saint, Patrick is to judge the men of<span class="page"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[page 165]</span>
Ireland on the Last Day at Clonmacnois.</p>
<p>
<i><b>The Hymn of Colum Cille.</b></i>&mdash;This composition has not
been preserved in its entirety. Fragments of it are
introduced into the Homiletic Introduction of VG, which
are enough to identify it with a short hymn to be found
in the Irish <i>Liber Hymnorum</i>, and published by Bernard
and Atkinson in their edition of that <a name="an29r" id="an29r"></a>compilation.<a href="#an29"><sup>29</sup></a>

<p>
Obviously the third stanza, with its reference to Colum
Cille himself, is a later addition, so that only the first
two stanzas belong to the original hymn. The sixth
line, <i>quem tu Christe</i>, is quoted in the section of VG
referred to; but the three other excerpts, <i>lucerna</i>&hellip;,
<i>custodiantur</i>&hellip;, <i>propheta</i>&hellip;, do not appear in the
text before us: nor do the surviving stanzas justify the
extravagant praise said to have been heaped on the
composition at Clonmacnois&mdash;though no doubt a composition
by Colum Cille, had it only the artless simplicity
of a nursery jingle, would have been sure of an appreciative
audience. However, the text seems to indicate
something much more elaborate, and probably the
original composition was an acrostic, like Colum Cille's
great <i>Altus <a name="an30r" id="an30r"></a>Prosator</i>.<a href="#an30"><sup>30</sup></a> The two authentic stanzas of the<span class="page"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[page 166]</span>
<i>Liber Hymnorum</i> are incorporated in the metrical
patchwork at the end of LB.</p>
<p>
Another version of the hymn was known to Colgan,
and is given by him in TT, p. 472. Unfortunately he
quotes only one couplet&mdash;</p>

which is evidently corrupt, and (as Colgan seems to regard
it as the opening stanza) must show that the whole text
had become disturbed by the time when Colgan wrote.
Indeed, it does not appear that Colgan knew any more of
the hymn than these two lines.</p>
<br />

<h4>LIII. THE ENVY OF THE SAINTS (VG)</h4>
<p>
Note how the Latin texts soften down the saying
attributed in VG to Colum Cille. A curious incident
of disagreement between Ciaran and Colum Cille is thus
related by Colgan (TT, p. 396). "Once there arose a
petty quarrel between Kieranus and Columba, in which
perhaps Kieranus, jealous for the divine honour, appeared
either to prefer himself to Columba, or not to yield him
the foremost place. But a good Spirit, descending from
heaven, easily settled the quarrel, whatever it may have
been, in this wise. He held out an awl, a hatchet, and
an axe, presenting them to Kieranus: 'These things,'
said he, 'and other things of this kind, with which thy
father used to practise carpentry, hast thou abjured for
the love of God. But Columba renounced the sceptre
of Ireland, for which he might have hoped from his
ancestral right and the power of his clan, before he made <span class="page"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[page 167]</span>
offering.'" The same tale is told in Manus O'Donnell's
Life (ed. O'Kelleher, p. 60).</p>
<p>
The authorities differ as to the attitude which Colum
Cille adopted with regard to Ciaran. But as regards the
other saints of Ireland there is no ambiguity. The
cutting-short of Ciaran's life was one of the "three
crooked counsels of Ireland" according to the glosses to
the <i>Martyrology of Oengus</i> (9th September): the same
authority adds that the saints "fasted for Ciaran's death,"
as otherwise all Ireland would have been his. The
ancient legal process of fasting was an inheritance from
Pagan times. If A had a case against B, he might, and
under certain circumstances was obliged to, abstain from
food till the case was settled; he was then said to "fast
upon B." The idea probably was that if a litigant
permitted his adversary to starve to death, the angry
ghost would ever afterwards disturb his rest. Parallels
have been found in ancient Indian practice. Sometimes
B performed a counter-fast; in such a case he who first
broke his fast lost his cause. But the process seems to
have been strangely extended, even in Christian times,
to obtain boons from the supernatural Powers. We
read of a saint "fasting upon God" that a king might
lose a battle; and in <i>Revue celtique</i>, vol. xiv, p. 28, there
is printed a story of a childless couple who fasted with
success upon the Devil, that he might send them offspring.
Two of the saints&mdash;Odran of Letrecha Odrain
and Mac Cuillind of Lusk&mdash;went and told Ciaran for what
they were fasting: Ciaran simply replied, "Bless ye the
air before me"&mdash;the air through which I must travel
in passing heavenwards&mdash;"and what ye desire shall be
given you." The <i>Book of Leinster</i> contains a poem
attributed to Saint Ciaran relating to the shortness of his
life: as it has apparently never been printed it is given
here with a translation, so far as the obscurity of the<span class="page"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[page 168]</span>
language permits&mdash;</p>

<h4>LIV. THE PANEGYRICS (LA, VG)</h4>
<p>
There is little that need be said about these paragraphs,
which are of conventional type. There are two references
in VG which may, however, be noted. The first is to the
relics left in the hollow elm, of which we have already
heard at the beginning of these annotations: here said
to have been deposited by Benen (the pupil of Patrick,
and his successor in Armagh) and by Cumlach (the leper
of Saint Patrick). The second is an allusion, on which
I am unable to throw any light, to some evidently
well-known story of a certain Peca and his blind pupil.</p>
<br />

<h4>THE METRICAL PANEGYRIC IN LB</h4>
<p>
This is a patchwork of extracts from different sources.</p>
<p>
<b>1.</b> Fifteen-syllable lines, with caesura at eighth
syllable; every line ending in a trisyllabic word, rhyming
(not always) with a word preceding the caesura. A
dissyllable or trisyllable precedes the caesura. Rhythm
of Tennyson's <i>Locksley Hall</i>, proceeding by stress only,
independent of vowel-quantity or hiatus. In line seven,<span class="page"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[page 170]</span>
'Keranus' must be pronounced in four syllables,
Kiaranus. Refers to the wizard's prophecy, incident II.</p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> Four lines, in <i>Locksley Hall</i> rhythm, with a dissyllabic
rhyme running through the quatrain. Relates
incident IX.</p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Four lines, twelve syllables trochaic, caesura at
seventh syllable. Each line ends with a trisyllable or
a tetrasyllable, with dissyllabic rhyme running through
the quatrain. The rhythm is that of the following line
(which is intentionally misquoted to serve the present
purpose)&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent1">
"Gather roses while you may, time is still a-flying."</p>

<p>
The incident is not recorded in the prose lives; but it
appears in the <i>Book of the Dun Cow</i>, in the story of the
Birth of Aed Slaine (son of King Diarmait, reigned
A.D. 595-600). Diarmait, it appears, had two wives
(for, notwithstanding his friendship to Ciaran, he was but
a half-converted pagan), by name Mugain and Muireann.
Muireann had the misfortune to be bald, and Mugain,
who, as is usual in polygamous households, was filled with
envy of her, bribed a female buffoon to remove her golden
headgear in public at the great assembly of Tailltiu
(Telltown, Co. Meath), so as to expose the poor queen's
defect to the eyes of the mob. The messenger accomplished
her purpose, but Muireann cried out, "God and
Saint Ciaran help me in this need!" and forthwith a
shower of glossy curling golden hair flowed from her
head over her shoulders, before a single eye of the
assembly had rested upon her. Compare Ciaran's own
experience, incident XLVI.</p>
<p>
<b>4.</b> Three lines in the same metre, but apparently with
three instead of four lines in each rhyming stanza.
Refers to incident XVIII.</p>
<span class="page"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[page 171]</span>
<p>
<b>5.</b> Three lines in the same rhythm as extract 1, but
with a different rhyme-scheme; apparently three lines
from a quatrain rhyming <i>abab</i>. Refers to incident XLI.</p>
<p>
<b>6.</b> Six lines in elegiac couplets. This probably refers
to XLVI, but without their original context the lines
must remain obscure. In any case the versifier has the
story in a rather different form from the prose writers, and
appears to regard it as an incident of the boyhood period.</p>
<p>
<b>7.</b> Eight lines from the hymn of Colum Cille, already
commented upon.</p>
<br />

<h4>ADDITIONAL NOTE ON CIARAN'S BIRTHPLACE</h4>
<p>
Some place-names in the barony of Moycashel (S. Co.
Westmeath), which lies in Cenel Fiachach, support the
tradition that Ciaran's birthplace is to be sought there,
and not in Mag Ai at all. I can find nothing in the
local nomenclature to suggest Ráith Cremthainn; but
"Templemacateer" (<i>Teampull mhic an tsaoir</i>, the
"Church of the Wright's son") may be compared with,
and perhaps equated to the similarly named "house"
(p. 111); "Ballynagore" (<i>Baile na ngabhar</i>, the "town
of the goats," or "horses") perhaps echoes the "Tir na
Gabrai" of VG 3. About half a mile to the west is
<i>Tulach na crosáin</i>, the "Mound of the crosslet"&mdash;possibly
the missing cross of Ciaran (LA 4). At the outflow of
the Brosna from Loch Ennell is "Clonsingle," which it
is tempting to equate to the place-name corrupted to
"Cluain Innsythe," in LA 12.</p>
<p>
An additional suggestion may here be made to the
effect that the eldest son and daughter of Beoit were
twins. Their names, <i>Lug-oll</i> "big Lug," and <i>Lug-beg</i>
"little Lug," are in correspondence, as twins' names
often are.</p>

Illum quoque pro resuscitatione eius munere debito
dotabis." Cumque regis filius de sompno euigilasset,
misit pro puero Kerano ut ad se ueneret; qui cum
sui presentiam ei exhiberet, atque sompnium seriatim
<span class="note">[seruatem <i>or</i> seritatem R1]</span> audiret, secundum quod
angelus illum docuit, equum aqua benedicta aspergens

siluestre, sicut ceteri pueri suis parentibus ferebant, non
portaret. Quod cum dilectus Deo et hominibus audiret,
mentem eleuans ad Puerum illum qui subditus erat
parentibus, aquam de fonte uicino allatam benedixit,
in nomine Eius qui mel potens est producere de petra,
et oleum de saxo durissimo; et mox aqua illa in mel
dulcissimum, Deo cooperante, conuertitur, et sic matri

Nam uacca una lactifera, una cum uitulo, consecuta est
eum, acsi a suo pastore minaretur post eum. Qui cum
ad sacrum collegium sancti Fynniani uenisset, gaudium
non modicum de eius aduentu omnes habuerunt. Vacca
uero, que secuta est eum, simul cum uitulo pascebatur,
nec ubera materna sine licencia tangere attemptabat.
Keranus eius pascua sic discriminauit atque distinxit, ut
tantum uitulum mater lambe[re]t, nec tamen ei ubera
praeberet. Istius uero uacce in tanta habundancia
exubrabat lac, ut xii uiris cotidie distributum sufficientem

ceruisiam ei per ministrum destinauit. Cumque illi
exenium tanti uiri presentaret, respondit ipse, "Vt

effudit; et uirtute orationis eius potiti, ratem suam

uero huius beneficii, optinuit a latronibus capita suorum
fratrum. Acceptis uero hiis, ad locum ubi corpora
iacuerant deueniens, Deum deuote rogauit ut omnipotenciam
suam in seruorum suorum resuscitatione hac

uitulum mugiendo huc illucque discurrebat. Causam
uero mugitus cognoscens mater Querani, cum indignatione

Erat enim iam frigidum tempus; sed ratem non habuit

Et quia caritas omnia sustinet, ticionem

iuxta ripam magni fluminis Synan arborem magnam
frondosam et fructiferam que totam obumbrauit Hyberniam.
Quod sompnium beato Edeo indicauit crastina

Igitur secundum Dei imperium qui reuelat

<p>

obuiam ueniens quasi subridendo ait, "Nonne presbitero
pudor est absque casula incedere?" Senanus enim in
spiritu nouit quomodo ipse pauperi eam dedit. Et ideo<span class="rightnote">° R2 129b</span>

cetera que eis necessaria erant propter Christum ministrauit.
Interea cum nocturne adessent tenebre, grandis<span class="rightnote">° R1 164a</span>

<p>
<b>14.</b> Monasterio in quo tunc uir Dei morabatur, erat
quaedam insula uicina, quam seculares quidam inhabitabant,
quorum tumultus uiros Dei multum molestabat.
Vnde contigit ut beatus Keranus, eorum inquietacione
compulsus, ad stagnum accederet, et orationi se totum
dans, elongationem illorum uexancium seruos Dei
perueniuit. Cum enim ab oratione cessaret, ecce subito

<p>
<b>15.</b> Vir Dei, cum in usum <span class="note">[usus MSS.]</span> pauperum bona

Quibus ipse acquiesce[n]s, et uale in Domino

instruens regula, uultu et habitu, sermone et uita, se eis
in exemplum exhibuit. Erat enim tanquam aquila
prouocans ad uolandam pullos suos quantum ad contemplacionis<span class="page"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[page 179]</span>

sicut minus <span class="note">[unus R2]</span> ex eis uiuebat. Erat enim in
spiritualibus meditacionibus suspensus ad supera;
infirma tum imbecillitate sic condescendebat ut quasi
uideretur se inclinare ad infima. Ipse quoque fide erat
perfectus, caritate feruidus, spe gaude[n]s, corde mitis,<span class="rightnote">° R1 164b</span>
ore affabilis,<sup>°</sup> paciens et longanimis, hospitalitate erat
humanus, in operibus pietatis semper assiduus, benignus,
mansuetus, pacificus, sobrius, et quietus. Et ut multa

studium Marie contemplacioni ac Marthe erga
temporalium dispensacionem ordinata succasione <span class="note">[succisione

<p>
<b>16.</b> Erat nihilominus prophecie spiritu inspiratus,

inquit "eius audio quem Deus uobis preficiet abbatem;
euntes ergo ipsum adducite." Illi itaque properauerunt,
atque ad portum peruenientes quendam adolescentulum
illiteratum inuenirent. Quem negligentes adducere ad
sanctum uirum reuersi neminem nisi adolescentulum
illiteratum qui profugus in siluis errabat se inuenisse
asseruerunt. Sanctus autem Queranus ait; "Adducite"
inquit "illum, et nolite futurum pastorem uestrum
despicere." Qui adductus Dei inspiracione et sancti
uiri instructione religionis habitum suscepit, et per
modum literas didicit. Ipse est enim sanctus Oenius,

At illi respondentes dixerunt "Eligimus," inquiunt
"ut illi qui post nos ueniunt in bonis temporalibus
habundent, et nos tollerantie mercedem in celis habeamus."
Et sic futurorum spe gaudentes, a potu abstinuerunt,

compaciens, uas aqua plenum benedixit, et iam

Defunctusque puer conspexit lumina uite,<br />

of two originally interlined glosses. Reference to the
MS. enables us to isolate these. The sentence there runs thus:
"Si ergo in isto loco mansissem non Ysseal .i. imus esset id
est non paruus sed altus .i. magnus et honorabilis." Here <i>id
est</i> occurs three times, once in full, and twice represented by
the common contraction .i., which is universally used in MSS. of
Irish origin for the introduction of a gloss. If we write the
sentence as below, we shall see the significance of the different
ways in which the expression is written, and by expunging the
glosses can make the sentence less clumsy and more intelligible</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
